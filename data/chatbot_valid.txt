<assistant> It's the most important thing to me .
<user> If you are hired , how long do you plan to stay with us ?
<assistant> That obviously depends on how things go - - whether I'm suited to the firm and the firm to me .
<user> Tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them .

<user> Here you are . I wonder how much interest can I earn from a current account .
<assistant> Oh , current accounts don't pay out interest .
<user> Why is that ?
<assistant> It's primarily designed for business transactions . That is , writing checks to pay for bills , buying things and sending money . We won't expect a large amount of deposit in a current account .

<assistant> Hi , Bill . I ' d like to take the apartment I looked at yesterday .
<user> All right .
<assistant> So , what do we do now ?
<user> This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords .

<assistant> How much does a six-day tour by train cost ?
<user> Five hundred yuan .
<assistant> Does that include hotels and meals ?
<user> Oh , yes , and admission tickets for places of interest as well .
<assistant> That sounds reasonable . What about the five-day flying journey ? How much is that ?
<user> Eight hundred and fifty yuan .
<assistant> Covering all expenses ?
<user> Yes . But there is no half fare for children . They must pay full fare .

<user> I can't believe you wear jeans to the office ! Are you trying to lose your job ?
<assistant> Of course not . I'm just observing casual day . On Fridays , the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire .
<user> Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ?
<assistant> We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes .
<user> I guess it lets people express their individual tastes . But won't some people abuse it ?
<assistant> Not really . Besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . People can't just wear whatever they want .
<user> It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity .
<assistant> Believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . Employees are actually more productive on casual days .

<assistant> That sounds good .
<user> Then , what's your usual commission rate for your agents ?
<assistant> Usually , we give a commission of 4  to our agents .
<user> 4  is too low , I think . You see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or TV , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . It all costs money , 4  is not enough .
<assistant> Don't worry . We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase .
<user> You mean to saya
<assistant> It sounds OK . Then how do you pay the commission ?
<user> We may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment .
<assistant> All right . If it's okay , we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately .
<user> Think it over . We hope to keep a good business relationship with you .
<assistant> Thank you for your help .

<user> That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step . Do you have the purchase price ?
<assistant> Yes , it's 110,000 RIB . So , with the down payment done , I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB .
<user> What we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20  down payment .
<assistant> Yes , I have everything here . OK , I'll come in and see you later today . Maybe I could have my new car as early as next week ! How exciting !

<user> Hi , my name is Tom .
<assistant> Tom , the new sales representative ? Nice to meet you ! I'm Melinda .
<user> Nice to meet you too.Melinda .
<assistant> Now let me show you around . This is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . Over here is the sales department .
<user> Really ? This is a nice office , but it's quite small .
<assistant> Yeah ... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there .
<user> It looks like you guys work hard .
<assistant> I tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard.Just kidding . Oh , your cubicle is over the . And this way . Those are all private offices the managers offices .
<user> Hmm ... Tell me more details about our jobs .
<assistant> Sure thing .

<user> What do you think of our price ?
<assistant> Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ?
<user> Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly .
<assistant> I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable .
<user> I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level .
<assistant> I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3  .
<user> I ' m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .
<assistant> Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ?
<user> We've already cut down our price to cost level .
<assistant> Is that all ?
<user> Yes , this is the best we can do .
<assistant> I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered .

<user> So , Jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ?
<assistant> It ' s great , dad . I don ' t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money .
<user> Even though you are only twelve , it ' s not too early to start saving a little money .
<assistant> I ' Ve never had a bank account before . Why don ' t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ?
<user> You know you would spend it . And also , money in the bank earns interest .
<assistant> But what if I need my money suddenly ?
<user> The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM .
<assistant> Great ! So it ' s almost the same as keeping it under the matters !
<user> Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges . But you don ' t have to worry about that yet . Let ' s go make your first depot
<assistant> OK . Guess I have to do that before . I can make money my first withdrawal .

<user> Is this where I can catch a bus to the theater ?
<assistant> Yes , but you can't get there with out a change .
<user> Which bus do I have to change ?
<assistant> You have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 .
<user> I see . Thank you .

<user> Here we are , Joan . This is the Palace museum , also known as the Forbidden city .
<assistant> Oh , how splendid ! Can you take a picture of me here ?
<user> Sure .

<user> Excuse me . I'm afraid I got lost . Where am I on this map ?
<assistant> We are here , bus station , we are in the heart of the city .
<user> Oh ! Can I go from here to the Zhongshan Park ?
<assistant> Head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right .

<user> Tony , could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ?
<assistant> Working hours are from 8: 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . Be sure not to be late or absent . Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month .
<user> Is there anything else ? How about my salary ?
<assistant> Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record .
<user> Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ?
<assistant> All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days .
<user> Okay , that's good . I get it .

<user> Kate , you never believe what's happened .
<assistant> What do you mean ?
<user> Masha and Hero are getting divorced .
<assistant> You are kidding . What happened ?
<user> Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce .
<assistant> That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ?
<user> Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out .
<assistant> That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ?
<user> Early in the New Year I guess .

<user> Overseas operator .
<assistant> I would like to make a collect call to Taipei , Taiwan , please .
<user> Your name , please .
<assistant> Tim Chen .
<user> What's the number , please .
<assistant> The area code is 2 , and the number is 2367-9960 .
<user> The line is connected . Please go ahead .

<user> Hello . Excuse me .
<assistant> Yes . Can I help you ?
<user> Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago .
<assistant> Of course I remember you .
<user> I think I lost my wallet here .
<assistant> Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything .
<user> Really ? You didn't find a wallet ?
<assistant> No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ?
<user> Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left ?
<assistant> No . It's been empty the whole time .
<user> Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened .
<assistant> I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ?
<user> No . My friend did .
<assistant> Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ?
<user> No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table .
<assistant> Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home .
<user> I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ?
<assistant> Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that .
<user> Should I call the police ?
<assistant> You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets .
<user> Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home .
<assistant> I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir .
<user> Thanks for your help .

<user> Good morning , young lady . You can call me Ma . Do you see anything you like ?
<assistant> Yes . Many things ! I especially love this beautiful quilt .
<user> That quilt was passed down to me from my ma in Holland .
<assistant> It sounds like a special quilt . Why do you want to sell it ?
<user> Well , this home is too big for me now , so I'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller . Therefore , I need to part with a few things .
<assistant> Oh , I see . Umm , how much do you want for the quilt ?
<user> Is fifteen dollars OK ?

<user> Have you got change for a thousand ?
<assistant> Let me see .

<user> May I come in , Mr Sun ?
<assistant> I ' d rather you didn ' t , Miss Yang . I ' m very busy now .
<user> Can I try later then ?
<assistant> Yes , of course .
<user> Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ?
<assistant> Well , uh ... I ' m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ?
<user> Do you mind if I sit down ?
<assistant> Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ?
<user> I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ?
<assistant> Yes . But why should you want to do that ?
<user> Do you mind if I speak frankly ?
<assistant> Not at all . Go ahead .
<user> Well . You see , I don ' t like the office . I don ' t like the staff . And I ' m afraid of you . And I don ' t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ?
<assistant> Yes . I ' d be delighted if you did .

<user> Where is that ?
<assistant> Take me to the airport , please .
<user> Are you in a hurry ?
<assistant> I have to be there before 17 o'clock .
<user> We'll make it except a jam . You know it's rush hour .
<assistant> There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
<user> I'll do my best .
<assistant> Here's twenty dollars .
<user> Do you have small bills ?
<assistant> No . If you can't break it , keep the change . But can you give me a receipt ?
<user> Here is your receipt . Thank you .

<user> Recently I have been getting headache and my eyes don't seems to see focus properly .
<assistant> When did you last time have your eyes checked ?
<user> Two years ago . At that time I had no problems.Now I can ' t even make out something ten meters away .
<assistant> Come over here . I will test your eyes . First cover your left eye like this , and when I point , please read the chart from the top , and go as far as you can , telling me which way the " E " points .
<user> All right .
<assistant> Good.Now the other eye .
<user> Well , this one is worse .
<assistant> Never mind , just read as far as you can .
<user> I can only read the first three lines .

<user> Is there a car park near the supermarket ?
<assistant> Yes , there is an underground car park near the supermarket .
<user> I see . Thanks .

<user> Oh , come on , Ultraman !
<assistant> What's up , Bro ? What's in the bulletin ?
<user> It says that there will be a blackout from 5 p . m . to 7 p . m . in our neighborhood today .
<assistant> Blackout ? Even the TV has the limit .
<user> Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?
<assistant> Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either !
<user> That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ?
<assistant> Oh , my god ! No air-conditioner !
<user> OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here .
<assistant> How about playing Barbie out there in the neighborhood ?
<user> Barbie ? You know , I might be seven , but I'm not a girl .
<assistant> Do you have a better plan ?
<user> All right , all right .

<user> Yes , ma'am , how could I help you ?
<assistant> I am wondering if you do facial care ?
<user> Yes , we do .
<assistant> How much would it be ?
<user> From 200 to 800 .
<assistant> I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ?
<user> No problem .

<user> Can I help you , Miss ?
<assistant> I would like to order 2 office-style cabinets and desk calendars . We want office-style cabinets in white . The catalogue number is 90 - f - 2356 .
<user> How soon do you want it ?
<assistant> Could you deliver it tomorrow ?
<user> No problem .
<assistant> Please handle the items carefully .
<user> Certainly .
<assistant> We will pay by collect on delivery .

<user> I hate to do this to you , Alice , but I ' m going to have to ask you to put in some more overtime .
<assistant> Does it have to be this afternoon , Mr . Fairbanks ? I ' Ve already made plans .
<user> Well , I would have preferred to do it today , but if you ' Ve already made plans , we can do it tomorrow .
<assistant> I ' d appreciate that , sir . How long do you think you ' ll need me to stay ?

<user> What ' s your attitude when do wrong things at work ?
<assistant> The buck stops here .

<user> Hello ! Is your company advertising for administrative assistant on the newspapers ?

<assistant> OK . I will call you soon . Bye now .
<user> Bye .

<user> Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview .
<assistant> It is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time .
<user> You'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview .
<assistant> The contents should be mainly descriptions of your background . And the length depends on the particular situation .
<user> Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation .
<assistant> To sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression .
<user> Selling yourself should go straight to the point , and the statement should be clear and brief .
<assistant> It should also be truthful and realistic . Do not blindly blow your own horn .
<user> You should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for .
<assistant> While you should not omit your weak points , they need to be described appropriately
<user> Time permitted , you could add certain examples to your description .
<assistant> Besides , in the interview , it is best that you make corresponding adjustments to apply your prepared contents flexibly .

<user> Hello ?
<assistant> Hi , Deborah ! This is John . I'm calling from Australia .
<user> What are you doing in Australia ?
<assistant> I'm attending a conference in Sydney this week . Remember ?
<user> Oh , right . What time is it there ?
<assistant> It's 10:00 P . M . And it's four o'clock in Los Angeles , right ?
<user> Yes - four o'clock in the morning .
<assistant> 4:00 A . M . ? I'm really sorry .
<user> That's OK . I'm awake now .

<user> John hasn't turned up and Stefan is ill . Do we have anyone on stand-by ?
<assistant> I'm afraid not , we're very short-staffed at the moment . Can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime ? Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement .

<user> Jack , let ' s go !
<assistant> Oh , you are out of breath ! What happened ?
<user> Some people are wildly shooting on the next street . We must leave here as soon as possible !
<assistant> Take it easy . They will get caught .

<user> Hello . May I speak to Jerry , please ?
<assistant> Sorry , but he is out for lunch right now .
<user> I see . Can you give me some idea how long he'll be back ?
<assistant> I think he will be back around 2:00 . If you like , please leave your name and phone number , I'll have him call you as soon as he comes back .
<user> That's nice . My name is Steven , my phone number is 6789777 . Okay , I'll be waiting for his call . Thank you and bye !
<assistant> My pleasure , bye !

<user> Excuse me , Miss .
<assistant> What can I do for you ?
<user> I've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed .
<assistant> What's your flight number ?
<user> Flight CA216 to Chengdu .
<assistant> Yes , it's true . It has been delayed .
<user> Could you please tell me why ?
<assistant> Yes , of course . The delay is due to heavy rain .
<user> How long will the delay be ? Do you have any further information about it ?
<assistant> I am sorry , we don't know the extent of the delay at present . But according to the latest weather forecast , there will be a change in weather soon .
<user> We have to wait . Well , is it possible for the rain to stop before noon ?
<assistant> It's hard to say . Weather is so changeable in the summer . Please listen to the latest announcement about your flight .
<user> Yes , I will . Thanks a lot . Bye !
<assistant> Bye

<user> What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck !
<assistant> I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .
<user> I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !
<assistant> I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ?
<user> I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .
<assistant> Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?
<user> I don't know .
<assistant> I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .
<user> What do you mean ?
<assistant> We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .
<user> I have plenty of gas .
<assistant> Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .
<user> So what can we do ?
<assistant> Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible .
<user> Alright . That's a good idea .
<assistant> I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .
<user> Days ?
<assistant> Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .
<user> Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .
<assistant> Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .

<user> Hey , buddy , can ' t you see there ' s a line ?
<assistant> Oh , sorry . I didn ' t know .
<user> What ? You haven ' t taken the bus before ?
<assistant> No , I ' m afraid not .
<user> Well , you have to wait in line like everyone else . Besides , you should let old people on first .
<assistant> Sorry .
<user> It ' s all right . Where are you going ?
<assistant> I wanted to see the White House .
<user> Oh , well you don ' t want this bus , anyway . It goes to Georgetown .
<assistant> Oh , no .
<user> It ' s all right , though . Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A .
<assistant> Oh , well thank you very much .
<user> You ' re welcome .

<user> Can I help you ?
<assistant> I'd like the double cheese burger meal , please .
<user> What kind of drink would you like with that ?
<assistant> Just coke will be fine .
<user> Would you like a super size meal ? Only 2 RIB more , you'll get large coke and fries instead of medium . And today we are offering free toys all the meal boxes .
<assistant> That sounds good , thanks , I'd like that . Actually I'd like sprite instead of coke , thanks .
<user> That's not a problem , Miss . Will that be it ?
<assistant> Yes , that's all .
<user> That will be 25RMB , please
<assistant> You got it .

<user> Do you have any night tours ?
<assistant> Yes , we will depart in 10 minutes .
<user> Is that a guided tour ?
<assistant> Yes , it is .
<user> That's fine . Let's get on the bus .

<user> I am sure we will make it up as soon as possible .
<assistant> That's nice .
<user> We hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings .
<assistant> Of course not . We have cooperated for a long time .

<user> I would like to purchase some meat .
<assistant> What kind of meat would you like to get today ?
<user> First off , I'm going to need a pound of ground beef .
<assistant> A pound of ground beef is  2.48 .
<user> That's perfect .
<assistant> What else will you be needing ?
<user> I'm also going to need three pounds of chicken breasts .
<assistant> The chicken breasts cost  4.05 per pound .
<user> What's the total price for the chicken ?
<assistant> It's going to be  12.15 .
<user> Okay , I think that will be all for me today .

<user> I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks .
<assistant> Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us .
<user> Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market .
<assistant> Do you sell direct to shops ?
<user> Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen .
<assistant> Do you keep a stock of these things ?
<user> In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course .
<assistant> That is , your commission .
<user> Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10  commission of the amount on every deal .
<assistant> Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5  commission .
<user> The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10  commission will not leave us much .
<assistant> According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ?
<user> We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with .
<assistant> We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ...
<user> Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ?
<assistant> Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10  commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect .
<user> Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products .
<assistant> Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details .
<user> Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ?
<assistant> Oh , yes . We will give you a 5  commission on every transaction .
<user> All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency .
<assistant> Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair .

<user> Excuse me , I ' m sorry to trouble you . My name is Susan Ransom , and I have placed several orders with you company .
<assistant> Yes , Mr . Ransom ? This is Karl Miller . How may I help you ?
<user> Well , I wonder if you could track an order I placed with you last month . It hasn ' t arrived yet .
<assistant> Certainly , Ms . Ransom . Do you have an order number ?

<user> Have you worked out the offers . Mr . Thou ?
<assistant> Yes , we have . Here's our CIF quotation sheet . Please have a careful look .
<user> Are the prices on the list firm offers ?
<assistant> Yes . All the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation .
<user> I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices .
<assistant> All these products are our best-selling lines . The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . And we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . What do you have in mind ?
<user> How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan .
<assistant> I understand . Our offer remains open for 4 days .

<user> Hello sir , may I help you ?
<assistant> Yeah , I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
<user> I see . Well , you have come to the right place . We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers .
<assistant> Sounds good . I don ' t want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range .
<user> We have this new ETC smart phone.It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications . It also has a built-in camera , mp3 player and touch screen . It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are .
<assistant> What about Wi-fi ?
<user> Of course ! You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home .
<assistant> One last thing . Is it waterproof ?

<user> We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet !
<assistant> Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy or a kitty !
<user> Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
<assistant> I will ! I ' ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard !
<user> What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .
<assistant> Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ?
<user> We ' re planning on having children soon , I don ' t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
<assistant> Fine ! Let ' s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome !
<user> I ' ll tell you what , I can get you some hamsters and we ' ll take it from there .
<assistant> Yay !

<user> Good evening , Mr . Lee and thank you for choosing our airline . We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ?
<assistant> Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ' t understand .
<user> From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ' s overbooked .
<assistant> I know what overbooked is , I just don ' t understand how that could happen ?
<user> Actually it ' s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ' t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats ,
<assistant> So who has to stay behind ?
<user> Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone .
<assistant> Ok . I ' ll volunteer . I could use a free ticket !

<user> I want to rent this apartment .
<assistant> I ' m glad to hear that .
<user> How much are you asking ?
<assistant> You will have to pay  1050 every month .
<user> I can ' t afford that .
<assistant> What can you afford ?
<user> I was thinking  800 a month .
<assistant> I ' ll need you to pay more than that .
<user> How much more ?
<assistant> How does  900 every month sound to you ?
<user> I can live with that .
<assistant> We have a deal then .

<user> Good morning , Miss Monica . Nice to meet you again !
<assistant> Good morning , Mr . Thomas , it is nice to see you too .
<user> After the internal discussion , we have all agreed that you are the most suitable person for this position among all the candidates . So , today let ' s talk about your expected salary and social benefits . What is your expected salary ?
<assistant> I ' Ve worked in the field for more than 4 years . Depend on my work qualifications and experience , I would like to have 5000 Yuan to start .
<user> The basic salary for your position in our company would be 4800 Yuan to start with increases giving according to your performance .
<assistant> It is a bit lower than I expected . But I can accept that . What are the working hours ?

<assistant> Hello . I'd like to speak to someone regarding my card .
<user> Sorry , I'm not quite sure if I understand . In what way , Sir ? Has your card been stolen ?

<user> Nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . So I am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive .
<assistant> What you said is true . But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . For example , to make more movie Ccds , so people will spend money buying them .
<user> But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past .
<assistant> Yes . Take myself for example . I seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead , I see films at home-watching Ccds .

<user> Okay , well I ' m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position .
<assistant> Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ' d like to clarify .
<user> Well feel free to ask me anything , and I ' ll try to fill in the details .

<assistant> I understand . And are there other bonuses included ?
<user> Well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . But we could go through all the details of that at a later date .

<user> Excellent . Well , what other questions do you have Rebecca ?

<user> Mr . Dick . Does the recommendation of the university play an important role ?

In the long period of cooperation , the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations , they trust each other well . If your university recommends you , you can be approved more easily .
<user> But I find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . So I doubt its authority .

<assistant> Send out an application through Job-wanted on the website .
<user> Can any unit see my information ?
<assistant> It's a two-way choice . And your application will be read .
<user> Which websites offer this service ?
<assistant> Sina , 21st Century Talent Net , and a few others .
<user> Thank you .

<user> Don ' t throw your weight around . I can ' t bear you any more .
<assistant> I dare you to say that again .

<user> I'm just going to let you go , since the arresting officer isn't here .
<assistant> What about my ticket ? Do I still need to pay ?
<user> Don't worry about it .
<assistant> I'm so glad for your help .

<user> Annie , do you like shopping online ?
<assistant> Yes , I like it , because it's convenient .

<assistant> So what is it ?
<user> You gotta help me out this time , buddy .
<assistant> Another tough thing , I guess .

<user> Hey ! What happened ? ! My song was only half way through and it skipped to the next song .

<assistant> You can bring us our salads when you bring us our entree .

<user> Let's close the deal at  4800 , OK ?
<assistant> You drive a hard bargain ! OK , that's a deal .

<user> I'm now on the Songshan airport getting ready for departure . I realized that I might have left my watch .
<assistant> Yes , Ma'am . May I have your name and room number ?
<user> My name is Terry . I stayed last night in your hotel in room 132 .
<assistant> What kind of watch is it ?
<user> It's a brand-new Seiko wrist watch .
<assistant> Yes , we have it .
<user> Oh , I'm glad to hear that . Would you kindly send it to the Hilton Hotel ?

<user> What are your thoughts on the apartment ?
<assistant> I think that it ' s absolutely gorgeous .
<user> There aren ' t any problems with the apartment ?
<assistant> I think that the apartment looks very nice , but I do see some problems .
<user> What problems ?
<assistant> I did notice a few stains in the carpet .
<user> We will have the carpet cleaned before you move in .
<assistant> You will ?
<user> Yes , but other than that , are there any more problems ?
<assistant> That was the only thing that I saw that was wrong with the apartment .
<user> I ' m happy that you find this apartment so appealing .
<assistant> It is . I love it .

<user> That China-gown of Tang-Dynasty style is so beautiful . Would you show it to me , please ?
<assistant> Absolutely . Here it is .
<user> Could I try it on ?
<assistant> Please do , the fitting-room is over there .
<user> It feels a little tight around the waist . Do you have a bigger one ?
<assistant> I'm sorry . We don't have this color in your size . We have some green ones in your size . Would you please have a look at this green one ?
<user> OK . How much does it cost ?
<assistant> It's 486 yuan .

<user> Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ?
<assistant> As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap .
<user> Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling .
<assistant> So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide .
<user> The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ?
<assistant> To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken .
<user> That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut .
<assistant> I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion .
<user> Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ?
<assistant> Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ?
<user> Good . Friday morning at 9 .

<user> Good morning .
<assistant> Good morning.This is Mary.Can I speak to Anne please ?
<user> I ' m sorry She isn ' t in at the momment.She will come back at half past nineCan I take a message for her ?
<assistant> Thank you.But I will call her later
<user> OK.Goodbye .
<assistant> Goodbye .

<user> Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ?
<assistant> I ' m all right , thanks . Just a little tired .
<user> Late night ?
<assistant> Yeah , I got home around two .

<user> We've been waiting here for nearly ten minutes now , and there still isn't a bus in sight .
<assistant> I'm afraid we'll be late for the party .
<user> Have you got the time , Tom ?
<assistant> Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch !
<user> But you bought it only last month .
<assistant> Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired .
<user> How long will it take us to get there ?
<assistant> I think about ten minutes by bus .
<user> It's not far away , then . Let's walk , it's beginning to rain .
<assistant> Wait ! I think I see a bus coming now . Let's hope it's the No . 22 bus .

<user> Hi , Mr . Smith . I'm Doctor Hawkins . Why are you here today ?
<assistant> I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up .
<user> Yes , well , you haven't had one for 5 years . You should have one every year .
<assistant> I know . I figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ?
<user> Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So try to come at least once a year for your own good .
<assistant> Ok .
<user> Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ?
<assistant> Yes .
<user> Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit .
<assistant> I've tried hundreds of times , but I just can't seem to kick the habit .
<user> Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I'll give you more information before you leave .
<assistant> Ok , thanks doctor .

<user> Good afternoon . Mr . Tylor's office ?
<assistant> I'm afraid you've got the wrong extension .
<user> I'm sorry , but could you please transfer this call to Mr . Tylor's office ?
<assistant> Sure , please hold on .
<user> Thank you .
<assistant> Now Mr . Tylor's on the line . Go ahead , please .
<user> You are so kind , you helped me a lot .
<assistant> You are welcome . Bye !

<user> Good afternoon , Lexington Software . Angelina Dawson , how can I help ?
<assistant> Hello , this is Quinn from IBA .
<user> Ah , hello Quinn . Oh dear , you are calling to tell me there is a problem , aren't you ?
<assistant> I'm afraid so , yes .
<user> Hmm ... well , it was my first attempt ! Is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ?
<assistant> Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake .
<user> What do you recommend we do ?
<assistant> I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible .
<user> I trust your judgement . Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now .

<user> Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache .
<assistant> You should go to the dentist .
<user> I hate dentists .
<assistant> Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .
<user> It always hurts . I hate going .
<assistant> Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .
<user> O . K . , O . K . , I ' ll go .
<assistant> Good . You'll feel better after you do .

<user> Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please .
<assistant> Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm .
<user> How long does it take to get there ?
<assistant> About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ' d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive .
<user> Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time !
<assistant> Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers .
<user> Great ! I ' ll take it .
<assistant> Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train !
<user> I understand . Thank you very much !
<assistant> Have a great trip .

<user> I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend .
<assistant> A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ?
<user> The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend .
<assistant> So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ?
<user> It sounds like it will be .
<assistant> I really hope it doesn't get cold .
<user> That would ruin things , I want to go so badly .
<assistant> The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know .
<user> That is true . The weather is constantly changing .
<assistant> It would be nice if the weather would never change .
<user> That would be great , then we could plan things sooner .
<assistant> True . Predictable weather would make life easier .

<user> Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other .
<assistant> If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company .
<user> Beneficial ? I don ' t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating .
<assistant> But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency .
<user> I doubt that .

<user> Do you eat a lot of healthy food ?
<assistant> Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind .
<user> You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt .
<assistant> What's special about these things ?
<user> Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled .
<assistant> Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now .

<user> I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job .
<assistant> You need to take a break , maybe a vacation .
<user> Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment .
<assistant> Is that so ?
<user> Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on .
<assistant> Have you decided ?
<user> Yes . I want to get a better job .
<assistant> Could you tell me why you want to quit ?
<user> I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
<assistant> Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ?
<user> I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .
<assistant> OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
<user> Thank you so much for your advice .
<assistant> And every best wish for your new job .
<user> Thank you .

<user> The train is leaving . Hurry up ! Which car are we in ?
<assistant> Let me see . Oh , No . 11 .
<user> Here we are , Car 11 . Let's get in .
<assistant> Seats No . 20 and 21 . It ' s nice that we ' Ve got a window seat .
<user> Let's put our suitcases on the rack .
<assistant> Oh , the baggage rack is full . Put them under the seat for the time being .
<user> All right .

<user> So , how should we get to the theatre ?
<assistant> Let's take the bus .
<user> I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .
<assistant> It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once .
<user> It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .
<assistant> We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .
<user> Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .
<assistant> If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?
<user> We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi .
<assistant> I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus .
<user> Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .
<assistant> It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .
<user> Thanks , that was nice of you .
<assistant> See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !

<user> Let's go over this plan again .
<assistant> From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg .
<user> And that is mostly flat , right ?
<assistant> Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba .
<user> And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ?
<assistant> That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop .
<user> It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride .
<assistant> Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ?

<user> Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ?
<assistant> I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her .
<user> I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . Room 908 is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet .
<assistant> Anyhow , I'd like to change our room .
<user> No problem , sir . We'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . Could you wait till tomorrow ? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning . There'll be some rooms for you to choose from .
<assistant> All right . I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep .
<user> Be sure . I'll make a note of that . Everything will be taken care of . And if there is anything more you need , please let us know .

<user> It's time for bed .
<assistant> I'm not ready to go to sleep . I'm not tired .
<user> It's quite late , and you have an early day tomorrow .
<assistant> I'm not going to be able to fall asleep .
<user> Why don't you try counting sheep ?
<assistant> I've tried that before . It really doesn't work .
<user> That's beside the point , you still need to go to bed .
<assistant> Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep ?
<user> If I let you do that , then you're just going to be up all night .
<assistant> I promise I'll go to sleep soon .
<user> No , you're going to sleep now , so good night .
<assistant> See you in the morning .

<user> I see myself as being honest , diligent , persevering and creative . And I have a strong sense of responsibility .
<assistant> How about your psychological resilience ?
<user> I think I can work well under pressure , if necessary .
<assistant> How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ?
<user> I will just be sincere and friendly to others , and I believe they will treat me the same way .
<assistant> You seem to be a kind-hearted lady .
<user> Thank you . I simply believe the goodness of human nature .
<assistant> Please tell me your weaknesses if you can .
<user> I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details . I am always in pursuit of perfection .

<user> Karen ? I need to go over a few things with you .
<assistant> Certainly . Mr . Graham . When would you like to meet ?
<user> I was thinking about this afternoon , after the sales meeting .
<assistant> Fine . At 3:30 ?

<user> I believe we ' Ve met before . My name's David .
<assistant> Yes , at your company , I think . I'm Frank .
<user> Oh , I remember now.Very nice to meet you again .
<assistant> Nice meeting you , too .

<user> I made my little brother cry .
<assistant> Shame on you !

<user> I need some mascara . Do you have good thickening mascara ?
<assistant> Of course . Here is our thickening mascara . We also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes .
<user> Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too . Do you have a color chart can look at ?
<assistant> We have a very wide selection of colors . And our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin . So it is very gentle on your eyelids . Would you like to sample some ?
<user> Oh , sure I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first .
<assistant> I can help you with that .
<user> Thank you .

<user> Is this the baggage claim area for flight KB256 ?
<assistant> Yes , we are on the same plane .
<user> But I am a transfer passenger . I have a connecting flight to Miami .
<assistant> So you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area .
<user> Yes.It ' s quite troublesome .
<assistant> Why not go and find a porter ?

<user> Billy , you don ' t look too well . Maybe you should take the day off school .
<assistant> But Mom ! Today we ' re playing football ! I love football !
<user> You ' Ve got a fever and playing football isn ' t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What ' s that on your arm ?
<assistant> I don ' t know . It was there when I woke up this morning .
<user> It ' s rash . I ' d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ?
<assistant> I bashed it against the chair in my room .
<user> Does it hurt ?
<assistant> A little , but not much .
<user> Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I ' ll take you to the doctor ' s after breakfast .
<assistant> If I ' m better this afternoon , can I go to school ?
<user> If you are better , but I doubt you will be .

<user> This is your schedule .
<assistant> You're going out of your way for us , I believe .
<user> You are our honored guests .

<user> Are there any vacancies still available ?
<assistant> Yes . We need a plumber here .
<user> I am looking for a job that is more advanced than that , such as sales manager or regional manager .
<assistant> I am sorry . They are not available now .

<user> My name is Mary , and I will be your waitress tonight .
<assistant> Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant .
<user> Before your main course , would you like to order an appetizer ?
<assistant> Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ?
<user> There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table .
<assistant> The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ?
<user> You know , that is one of my favorites !
<assistant> OK , I'll take one order of that .
<user> You could choose another appetizer for half price to share .
<assistant> Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings .

<user> I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there's something wrong with the fax machine .
<assistant> What's wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ?
<user> Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ?
<assistant> Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out .

<user> I would like to speak to you , if you don ' t mind .
<assistant> What would you like to speak to me about ?
<user> I would like to talk to you about this year ' s election .
<assistant> Is that right ?
<user> I am a volunteer for this year ' s campaign .
<assistant> That ' s wonderful . I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand .
<user> I know history is about to be made , and I would like to be a part of it .
<assistant> That ' s fantastic .
<user> Are you planning on voting ?
<assistant> I ' m going to vote .
<user> Go to your polling place early on Election Day .
<assistant> I will . Good luck with your volunteering .

<user> We hope that there will be no repetition of this kind of trouble in the future .
<assistant> Yes . I promise it will not happen again .
<user> We look forward to your settlement at an early date .
<assistant> We will inform you as soon as possible .

<user> Hello , Steven . How do you get along with your job ?
<assistant> Actually , I learn many things from it . I find that I am a quick learner in new things .
<user> Practice makes perfect . By the way , what do you learn from your job ?
<assistant> At first I didn't know anything about the machine . Now I know how to operate it . Besides , the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement .
<user> Yeah , you are a good learner . I must commend you for your good performance .
<assistant> Thank you . That's a long way to go for my job .
<user> I appreciate your effort very much . The coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work .
<assistant> OK , let's go .

<user> Where on earth are we ?
<assistant> Judging by all the traffic , I'd say we're near the outskirts of the city .
<user> What did I do wrong ? Did I take a wrong turn ?
<assistant> I'm not sure , but I think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge .
<user> Well , now we should turn back a few kilometres .
<assistant> It seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map .

<user> Hello . Front desk .
<assistant> Yes . This is Bob Robinson . I ' m calling from room number 627 .
<user> Hi , Bob . What can I do for you ?
<assistant> Is it possible to change to another room ?
<user> Could you please tell me why ?
<assistant> My room is facing the swimming pool . It ' s noisy for me . I have a problem sleeping . And I feel uncomfortable when I take an elevator .
<user> So you need a quiet side room on the lower floor .
<assistant> You ' re right .
<user> Okay . Let me check for a room on the first floor .
<assistant> Thank you .
<user> I ' Ve only two rooms on the first floor . How about room 108 ?
<assistant> That ' s fine . Can I move now ?
<user> Sure . I ' ll send the bellman to help you .
<assistant> Oh , thank you kindly .
<user> You ' re welcome .

<user> How long will it take for our order to be delivered ?
<assistant> Let's see . You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles .
<user> Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control .
<assistant> No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go .

<user> Now you're my boss , Mr . Henry .
<assistant> Do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
<user> No , nothing in particular .
<assistant> You may ask questions about us , if you have any .
<user> All right . When can I start ?

<user> What are you doing here today ?
<assistant> I would like to fight my ticket .
<user> Is the arresting officer in the courtroom today ?
<assistant> Yes , the officer is here today .
<user> What's your case ?
<assistant> I was pulled over for running a red light , but I never did .
<user> Do you believe that the officer lied ?
<assistant> There was a camera on the signal . So , he was obviously lying .
<user> Your license plate was caught on camera ?
<assistant> A picture of my license plate was never taken .
<user> Since there is no picture of your license plate on record , I'm going to let you go .
<assistant> Thank you . I'm glad that you believe me .

<user> Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ?
<assistant> Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long .
<user> Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices .
<assistant> That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options .
<user> What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ?
<assistant> Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into .
<user> So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?
<assistant> Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .
<user> Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will .
<assistant> After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ' m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice .

<user> what shall we do after the volleyball match ?
<assistant> how about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym .
<user> that's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
<assistant> me , too . What did you have in mind ?
<user> I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must .
<assistant> I agree . They're very lovely , especially " Huan Huan " .
<user> is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ?
<assistant> the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive .
<user> oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ?
<assistant> I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now .
<user> any other ideas ?
<assistant> there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts .
<user> it all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have .

<user> Mom ! I hate eating vegetables !
<assistant> You don ' t have to eat them . I don ' t mind .
<user> Thanks mom ! Can I have dessert now ? I love chocolate cake !
<assistant> No dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables .
<user> But I don ' t like them ! It ' s not fair !
<assistant> You can have some fruit for dessert . If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake .
<user> Ok ... actually , I don ' t mind eating peas and carrots , buy I hate broccoli and cauliflower .
<assistant> I ' ll remember that for next time . You ' ll get extra peas and carrots , buy no broccoli or cauliflower . OK ?
<user> Thanks mom !

<user> It was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place . It gave me a good idea of your product range .
<assistant> It ' s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers . What ' s your general impression , may I ask ?
<user> Very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your NW Model .
<assistant> That ' s our latest development . A product with high performance . We put it on the market just two months ago .
<user> The machine gives you an edge over your competitors , I guess .
<assistant> Certainly . No one can match us as far as speed is concerned .
<user> Could you give me some brochures for that machine ? And the price if possible .
<assistant> Right . Here is our sales catalog and literature .
<user> Thank you . I think we may be able to work together in the future .

<user> Is the factory fully-automated ?
<assistant> Not completely . Our production process is partially-automated . We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually .
<user> What about supply of parts to the production line ?
<assistant> Well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line .
<user> What about the smaller components ?
<assistant> They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory .

<user> I'm glad you're on your ten-year reunion planning committee .
<assistant> Yeah , you get the TV to yourself while I spend my nights surfing the Net for missing classmates .
<user> That's not why . This way I can see how you guys do this sort of thing .
<assistant> I guess . Don't you have reunions in Taiwan ?
<user> Definitely . Every year . But just for our forty-person class .
<assistant> Ours are for everyone that graduated in the same year .

<user> What does your job involve ?
<assistant> I'm the Project Manager so I have to make sure our projects run smoothly . I work with three Project Engineers . They take care of after-sales service and look after the maintenance side of the business .

<user> How many languages can you speak ?
<assistant> Besides Chinese , I can speak English and French .
<user> You mean you can read and write both of them ?
<assistant> No , I can only carry on a simple conversation in French .
<user> Can you read and write English well ?

<assistant> I don't think I have any problem with our Chinese partners . They have always followed the contract strictly . We can do business directly with the corporation . As I mentioned before , the Chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law . Its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies .
<user> Well , it's known that the Sino-American relation is in a dilemma . Does it influence your business in China ?
<assistant> Actually not at present . But we are afraid it will . You know policies influence business to some extent . I hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists . China is really a large market . We don't want to lose it .

<user> Right , let me run through your options . You can go ahead and cash your undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate if you really want to , but I'd recommend a Personal Durable Commodities Loan .
<assistant> OK , what does that entail ?
<user> It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . If you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances .
<assistant> Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ?
<user> Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate .
<assistant> I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ?
<user> Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu .
<assistant> Absolutely , Jenny . Thanks very much , I think you've saved me quite a lot of money today .

<user> Well , it's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . So , unfortunately you'll lose this 50 RIB . We'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .

<user> Perhaps it's the starter then ?
<assistant> Yes , that's possible .

<user> The consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us . We have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality I am afraid .
<assistant> Is there anything wrong ?
<user> We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard .
<assistant> It's hard for us to believe it . Our instruments have been the best quality for years . Have you any reliable evidence ?
<user> Here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in London . You may inspect the defective instruments personally
<assistant> Well . According to the contract , we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . We ' ll send our technicians to repair them .
<user> Forty faulty instruments means that 4  are not up to the standard . You should compensate us for 4  of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee .
<assistant> I am sorry about the quality problem , but I propose we compensate you for 3  of the total value apart from the inspection fee .
<user> All right . In that case we are still willing to do business with you .

<assistant> Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ?
<user> Sure , when those never ending meetings .

<user> I don't think you've met my sister , Mary .

<assistant> All right .

<user> Excuse me , would you tell me how to return to Hilton Hotel . I'm afraid I lost my way .
<assistant> Did you have hotel card or something ?
<user> Let me see . Yes , I have the address and hotel telephone number here .
<assistant> Oh , you stay at the down town Hilton . When you go down two blocks this way and turn left , you will find it on your right .
<user> I don't understand very well . Could you give me a map ?

<user> The bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ?
<assistant> I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ' m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself .
<user> So , let ' s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ' Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ' t they ?
<assistant> Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ' t need to be replaced .
<user> How long did it take you to do the tiling .
<assistant> As I hadn ' t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether .
<user> I think you ' Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ?
<assistant> You ' ll be lucky ! However , I ' ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself .

<user> I'd like to see that pen , please .
<assistant> You mean this one ?
<user> No , the other one in the brown case .
<assistant> Oh , this one ... Here .
<user> May I try it ?
<assistant> Sure .
<user> It's very smooth . I'll take it .
<assistant> Cash or charge ?
<user> Charge , please .

<user> I ' Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles .
<assistant> We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days .
<user> Why , your price has soared . It ' s almost 25  higher than last year ' s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price .
<assistant> I ' m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere .
<user> I ' m afraid I can ' t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ' Ve received from other sources .
<assistant> But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ' s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries .
<user> I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ' s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ' t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ' t changed much over the years .
<assistant> There ' s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ' s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price .
<user> Well , we ' ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ' ll have to try , I suppose .

<assistant> He seems to be quite qualified . If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves .

<user> I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable !
<assistant> Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him .
<user> He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .
<assistant> I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .
<user> I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me .
<assistant> Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss .
<user> Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .
<assistant> Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper .
<user> I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?
<assistant> I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions .

<user> hey , you look great ! how's everything ?
<assistant> yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit .
<user> really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work .
<assistant> it's important to do proper exercises .
<user> you're right . Too much or too little won't do any good .
<assistant> the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet .
<user> sounds reasonable .
<assistant> we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
<user> and fruits !
<assistant> surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .
<user> I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
<assistant> yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can help one to keep sound physical health .
<user> I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .
<assistant> you bet it !

<user> Staying out all night , you frightened me to death .
<assistant> I stayed with my friends .
<user> You should at least give me a call .
<assistant> I'm sorry , Mum .

<user> Did anyone call ?
<assistant> Just Mr . White .
<user> What did he want ?
<assistant> He wouldn't say over the phone .

<user> What kind of job do you intend to do ?
<assistant> I want to do some management job since I have three-year's work history .
<user> What are your plans if you were hired ?
<assistant> I would apply my specialty and experience to my job and gradually move up to the management level in this company .

<user> You stepped on my foot !
<assistant> Sorry . I didn't mean to .

<user> what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ?
<assistant> while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement .
<user> why not ?
<assistant> the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing !
<user> it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking .
<assistant> I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children .
<user> I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking .
<assistant> all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty .
<user> perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow .
<assistant> I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them .
<user> that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad .
<assistant> you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking .

<user> Good morning . Could I speak with Mr . Willard please ?
<assistant> This is he . Who ' s calling , please ?
<user> This is Chris Emerson speaking .
<assistant> Hello , Chris . How can I help you ?

<user> Can you tell me the differences between a letter and a memorandum , Miss Thong ?
<assistant> Certainly . A letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted . A memorandum is a communication within an organization .
<user> Should we use the layout we use for a letter when we write a memorandum ?
<assistant> No , not necessary . Usually we have a set form which is printed . We just fill in the printed forms and send it to the person or the offices concerned in the company .
<user> Of course , let me find one for you .

<user> Hi , do you have any tickets for the show tonight ?
<assistant> Sorry , it ' s all sold out .

<user> Ok . I ' ll take it .
<assistant> Where would you like to sit ?
<user> Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes .
<assistant> Certainly .

<user> Lily , I am terribly sorry about this . But we have to put off or cancel tomorrow's meeting .
<assistant> Cancelled ? That's just can't happen !
<user> Sorry to say , but nothing can be done . The equipment broke down and can't be fixed till Friday .
<assistant> Oh , I hope it be fixed on Friday .

<user> Overseas operator , may I help you ?
<assistant> Yes . I would like to place a collect call .
<user> Can you tell me the name and number of the person you want ?
<assistant> Terry and his number is 4562325 8 .
<user> Please wait a moment . It Will take a few seconds to get through .

<user> Would you help me figure out what to do about the office party ?
<assistant> I would be happy to help . What would you like me to help with , food or entertainment ?
<user> I would like to help you with both .
<assistant> That will work out fine . To make sure everything goes together , do you think this party should be casual or dressy ?
<user> A dressy party would be fun !
<assistant> That will work out fine . Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best ?
<user> We should probably have both .
<assistant> Yes , that will work out fine . Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ ?
<user> Maybe we could do both !
<assistant> Everything sounds great then ! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details .

<user> I can't find the price tag .
<assistant> It's right here .  100 .
<user> But I heard other stores were having great mark-downs on this item .
<assistant> Ours are of really good quality .
<user> I see , please wrap it .

<user> Peter , how often do you exercise ?
<assistant> Well , I swim and run every day .
<user> Now , tell me , what do you eat ?
<assistant> Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .
<user> Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
<assistant> Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
<user> What do you drink ?
<assistant> Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .
<user> What do you drink ?

<user> Where can I call a taxi ?
<assistant> There's a taxi rank over there , right outside the gate .

<user> How did your company's fundraiser go ?
<assistant> The fundraiser events went really well . We were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society . All of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research .
<user> So how does it work ? How were you able to make money with the marathon ?
<assistant> Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars .
<user> Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society .
<assistant> In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause .

<user> How may I help you today ?
<assistant> I need to open a second account .
<user> What kind of account would you like to open ?
<assistant> I need another savings account .
<user> Do you have another account with us ?

<user> Have you ever been a student cadre ?
<assistant> Yes . I used to be the monitor of my class .
<user> Did it affect you much ?
<assistant> It ' s a very important experience for me . First , it improved my organizing ability , and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective . Second , it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who I like or dislike .
<user> In your spare time , do you have any part time jobs ?
<assistant> Yes , I used to work as an assistant lawyer for Tienda Law Office .

<user> What kind of a car do you have ?
<assistant> An old one .
<user> I know it's old , but what make is it ?
<assistant> It's a Chevrolet . Why do you ask ? You going into the car business ?
<user> Nothing like that . My cousin is going to take a job overseas and he can't take his car with him , so he's going to sell it - cheap . It's practically new .
<assistant> well I have been thinking about getting a newer car . I can't afford a brand new one .

<user> How about your interview ?
<assistant> They turned me down .

<user> What a shame ! You should have showed yourself to them !
<assistant> It doesn't matter . I'll try other companies .
<user> I suggest you hunt for a job on the Internet .

<user> No . I am sure about that .
<assistant> OK . Could you give me a receipt ?
<user> Yes . This is your receipt .

<user> Excuse me . Would you mind trading seats with me ?
<assistant> Not at all .
<user> Oh , thank you . That ' s very kind of you .
<assistant> You ' re welcome . I prefer a window seat .
<user> Oh , you do ? Good . Looking out of the window sometimes scares me . So I prefer to be the man in the middle .

<user> Do you plan to further your study ?
<assistant> Yes , I have been always learning the Economics on my own . My dream is to get a master's degree in Economics .
<user> If you make every effort to the company , you will have a great chance to attend the on-the-job postgraduate . The tuition fee will be financed by our company .

<assistant> What's it look like , lady ? This is the ticket line I'm standing in , isn't it ?

<user> You just cut into line , in front of me and everyone else , that's what ! Go take your place back at the end of the line , like every - one else !
<assistant> Oh sure , lady , and fat chance I'd get a ticket before they're sold out . I'm staying right here , understand ? So be a nice lady and butt out !
<user> Just what gives you the right ... ?
<assistant> Because I'm no sucker ; only suckers go to the end of the line . It's as simple as that , lady .
<user> Well , you're no gentleman , either .
<assistant> Okay , lady , just to show what a gentleman I really am , I'll let you go in front of me . Now , just buy your ticket and shut your trap , will you , lady ?
<user> Whew ! I got the last one . This must be my lucky day !
<assistant> What was that you just said ? Last one ... ? Hey , they've closed the ticket window !
<user> Yes , I'm afraid I bought the last ticket , and to think , if you hadn't been such a gentleman . . .

<assistant> Glad to meet you , Mr . White .
<user> Miss Lu , have you got any experience in restaurant service ?
<assistant> Yes . Since I entered college , I have been working at a fast food restaurant as a part-time waitress .
<user> For how long ?
<assistant> 3 years .
<user> Our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . Can you serve them in English ?
<assistant> That's why I applied for this job . Now I am studying Hotel English in my college , and I am quite familiar with the western courtesy and restaurant etiquette . I am sure my public relation skills will leave a strong impression on your customers .
<user> You must know our working hours are very long and overtime work is frequent .
<assistant> I don't mind that .
<user> I think I will give you a 3 months ' trial . The salary for this period is 800 yuan a month with no bonus . After that period if we both feel satisfied , a formal contract would be signed .

<user> It ' s just the right size-a perfect fit ! Have you seen anything you like ?
<assistant> I ' m thinking about buying this sweater . I know it ' s June now , but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
<user> It looks too big for you , but I like the color and the material is good quality . Is it on sale ?

<user> I'm sorry , but Mr.Thomas left the office a few minutes ago .

<user> I'm afraid not . He's gone for the rest of the day .
<assistant> Is there anywhere I can reach him ?

<user> Bye-bye .

<assistant> There ' s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions . I enjoyed reading her thought . The " which ? " section is very interesting this month . They tested facial cleaners . The article recommends " all clear " for effectiveness and price .
<user> I like to take the tests that they print in this magazine .
<assistant> Which tests do you mean ?
<user> You know . Tests like " how jealous are you ? " and " are you a fashion victim ? "
<assistant> Oh , I see . I like to do those tests , too , but I don ' t take them seriously .
<user> Of course not , but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do . According to the jealousy test , I ' m quite a jealous type of person . Perhaps I need to control my jealousy .

<user> Marry Wang's Office , this is Marry .
<assistant> Hi Marry , this is Tom .

<assistant> Yes , we had a meting about it yesterday afternoon .
<user> What's the answer ?
<assistant> We decided that we could agree to your price , but we are a bit worried about the slow delivery .
<user> Let me see . I quoted your delivery in three months , didn't I ?
<assistant> Yes , but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible .
<user> I thought you would be worried about it . So I rang Auckland last night . As you are our biggest customer , they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave Auckland next month .
<assistant> Good , if you agree we'll draft the agreement right away and sign it then .
<user> By all means .

<user> Be careful . The floor is wet .
<assistant> What happened ?
<user> I spilled my drink .

<user> Hello , this is Lucie Jing calling from Lincoln Bank . May I speak to Mr Was , please ?

<user> What are we eating for lunch ?
<assistant> I have no idea . What about you ?
<user> I kind of want pizza .
<assistant> I ate pizza the other day .
<user> So , what do you feel like eating then ?
<assistant> How about some burgers ?
<user> I already had a burger yesterday .
<assistant> What are we going to do ?
<user> We can just each get what we want to get .
<assistant> That sounds like a plan .
<user> Do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ?
<assistant> I think they sell both at the cafeteria .

<user> Did you bring your certificate for nursing ?
<assistant> Yes , here is my Certificate of Nurse .
<user> How about your nursing education ?
<assistant> I learnt nursing through theory and practice for 3 years at Hunan Nursing School .

<assistant> Yes , pretty well . I have started learning English since primary school .

<user> Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ?
<assistant> My husband and I have thought about it , but we've decided not to have any . They're just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of Worl
<user> Well , I've always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ?
<assistant> For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share .
<user> Don't you think you would miss having other people around ?
<assistant> No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy
<user> If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ?
<assistant> That's true . But as a woman , I'm glad that even though I don't want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can't imagine what China would be like
<user> Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ?
<assistant> I don't know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children !

<user> Ok , let ' s go through this one more time . I don ' t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses !
<assistant> I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
<user> Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .
<assistant> So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ?
<user> Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
<assistant> Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ' s all set right ?
<user> No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
<assistant> You know what ? I ' ll just have everything dry cleaned .

<user> Is Tom in ?
<assistant> No , he is at work now .
<user> May I have his office phone number please ?
<assistant> Sure . It's 289,1234 .

<user> What about driving to Shanghai ?
<assistant> Driving ? No way , it's too far .
<user> I just thought it would be an interesting way to see lots of places . How long will it take ?
<assistant> Too long , and you do not have much time .
<user> What a pity .

<user> Good afternoon . I'll show you to your room .
<assistant> Thank you .
<user> Could you tell me which bags are yours ?
<assistant> They're over there next to the door . Those three with green tags on them .
<user> Could you wait a moment ? I have to get a trolley . May I see your room key , please ?
<assistant> Sure , here it is .
<user> Thank you . Room 402 . You're on the 4th floor . This way , please .

<user> Excuse me , sir . Is there anything I can do for you ?
<assistant> Yes . I bought the can two days ago , but today I found that is beyond the guarantee period .
<user> Let me see . I am sorry , sir . We will change another one for you . Please wait a moment .

<user> Excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ?
<assistant> The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . The station is at the end of that street .
<user> How long will it take me to get there ?
<assistant> It's about a ten-minute walk .
<user> That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you .
<assistant> Not at all .

<user> Excuse me ! Does this bus go to the railway station ?
<assistant> No , You're got on the wrong bus . You can take a No . 22 bus at the University station and then transfer to a No . 83 bus at the railway station .
<user> OK ! Thank you very much !

<user> I have here our price sheet on a F . O . B . basis . The prices are given without engagement .
<assistant> Good , if you ' ll excuse me , I ' ll go over the sheet right now .
<user> Take your time .
<assistant> I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high .
<user> I ' m surprised to hear you say so . You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years .
<assistant> We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ' s reasonable , isn ' t it ?
<user> Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ' ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly .
<assistant> The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ' s settle that matter first .
<user> Well , as I ' Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ' re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent .
<assistant> When I say your prices are much too high , I don ' t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent .
<user> How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ?
<assistant> To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help .
<user> Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ?
<assistant> I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ' s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ?
<user> Very well , I will .

<user> Excuse me , you look lost.Can I help you ?
<assistant> Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station .
<user> Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right .
<assistant> Right ? OK , got it .
<user> Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ?
<assistant> Next left then right ? OK .

<user> I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said .
<assistant> I said , ' Do you want me to help you ? '
<user> I'm trying to find a post office .
<assistant> Go three blocks and turn right . It's right there .
<user> Should I take the bus ?
<assistant> No . It'll only take about five minutes to walk .
<user> Thank you very much .
<assistant> Anytime .

<user> It says here that you graduated from Beijing Normal University with a major in English Language and Literature .
<assistant> Right . Then you may think that I am not fit for this job according to my educational background .
<user> Yes .
<assistant> But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people . So I took an evening course at the Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate .
<user> So you must be an extravert ?
<assistant> Yes , I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them .
<user> What do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ?
<assistant> A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities , and offering service of transportation , accommodation , sightseeing , shopping and entertainment .
<user> Don't you consider it a hard work ?
<assistant> Hard but interesting , I think .
<user> Have you any experience as a tourist guide ?
<assistant> Yes , I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University .
<user> Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English ?
<assistant> Yes , I have learned a little French and Japanese as well .

<user> Didn ' t you punch in this morning , Monica ?
<assistant> Sorry , I don ' t know the rule about punching .
<user> That ' s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule .
<assistant> Do we also need to punch out after work ?
<user> According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ' clock and punch out after 5 o ' clock every work day .
<assistant> How about the lunch break , Lucy ?
<user> From 11 thirty to 1 o ' clock .
<assistant> May I ask whether we need to work overtime ?
<user> Sometimes , but not quite often .

<user> This needs dry-cleaning.Can you remove this stain without harming the fabric ?
<assistant> Let me see . We ' ll try , but I ' m not sure that we can remove it .
<user> Ok , then . We ' ll I ' d also like to have this pressed .
<assistant> Any starch ?
<user> No starch .

<user> What's the problem ?
<assistant> I have a laceration on my left forearm .
<user> Let me have a look . How did this happen ?
<assistant> I got hit by a car in an accident .
<user> Was there much bleeding afterward ?
<assistant> No , not much .
<user> Well , this doesn't look too serious . Nurse , could you please get me a suture set ?
<assistant> Will I need stitches ?
<user> Yes . Three , I think . It wont ' be too painful . Alright , we're done . That wasn't so bad , was it ?
<assistant> No , not really .
<user> You're lucky there was no lasting damage . I'll set up an appointment for you to come back in five days . We'll take those stitches out then . So long .
<assistant> Thank you , doctor . Bye .

<user> What time is it ?
<assistant> Ten to nine .
<user> Your watch is ten minutes slow . So it's should be nine sharp . I'm gonna be late again . What will be my excuse this time ? It should be set the alarm for seven thirty .
<assistant> Don't cry over spilled milk , Fred ? Could you stay with me a few minutes ?
<user> What ? Why ? What's wrong with you ?
<assistant> I just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking.It ' s so lonely and boring . My sickness makes it worse . When will I recover ?
<user> You will be fine in the couple of month , just be patient . I've got to woke now , I'll be late .
<assistant> You only care about your work .
<user> Sorry , baby , you are everything to me . all I do just for our family .
<assistant> Stay just a few minutes longer , OK ?
<user> OK , I'll leave at 9:15 , Is that all right ?
<assistant> Yes .
<user> I'll spent more time with you in the future , Dina .
<assistant> Thank you .

<user> Canton Hotel .
<assistant> I'd like to reserve a double room . I will be arriving next Monday , the 12th . My name is Wilson .
<user> A double room for the 12th ? The name is Wilson ?
<assistant> Yes , that's right .
<user> How long will you be staying ?
<assistant> Three or four days , perhaps longer .
<user> Very good , sir . We will be expecting you next Monday , the 12th .

<user> How is the result of your lab test ?
<assistant> When it comes to that , I have a lot to say .
<user> Then say it .
<assistant> When I went back to my doctor to hear the results of my lab tests , I tried to keep a poker face even though I was scared to death . Then you guess what he said .
<user> That ' s just what I want to know .
<assistant> He told me the tests were negative and there was nothing wrong with me .

<user> Could you tell me something about your family ?
<assistant> OK . There are five people in my family , Father , mother , elder brother , younger sister and I .
<user> Are your brother and sister still in school ?
<assistant> My brother has found his job and my sister is still in college .
<user> What does your father do ?
<assistant> My father is a middle school teacher .
<user> What about your mother ?
<assistant> My mother is a housewife .
<user> Are you married ?
<assistant> I am not married yet and I live alone now .
<user> Do you need to support your family ?
<assistant> No , my father and brother are doing that .
<user> Have you finished school ?
<assistant> Yes , I have already graduated .

<user> I'm in heaven ! A Whirlpool dryer !
<assistant> I love them , too . Let's move into the kitchen . Wait until you see the refrigerator .
<user> This is too good to be true .
<assistant> And the stove is brand new . You know how to use a gas stove , right ?
<user> Yes . We've lived in Taiwan for a while . I had a gas stove in the States , too .
<assistant> It's better for cooking Chinese food . Well , what do you think ?
<user> We love it . But we'd like to know about the neighbors .

<user> How's your new car ?
<assistant> Perfect ! Couldn't be better .
<user> You made a good choice , then ?
<assistant> It's just what I want .
<user> No regrets ?
<assistant> I am really pleased with it .
<user> I am glad you are happy .
<assistant> It's super .

<user> Good afternoon , Sir . You're here to see about a Temporary Loan , right ? The loans we offer are for purchasing income-generating assets . Is that what you require ?
<assistant> Yes , that's exactly what I need . How about terms for these ?
<user> Well , we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans . The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period .
<assistant> Is there any flexibility on that ?
<user> Unfortunately , not .
<assistant> OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan .
<user> Not a problem , Sir . If you'd just fill out these forms , and of course with necessary clearance , we can get you the money right away .

<user> Mr . Wang , I've had scheduled for your two days stay in Shanghai . You can make some changes if it does not suit you .
<assistant> All right . Please read it to me .
<user> On Friday morning , Mr . Wang , the director of Shanghai Research Institute , will visit you at the hotel . In the afternoon , you will discuss some problems with Mr . Yang , vice manager of computer corporation .
<assistant> Very good .
<user> On Saturday , you'll leave the hotel for sightseeing . Miss Lu will be your guide .
<assistant> Oh , that's great .

<user> Hi , I would like to return this TV .
<assistant> Sure , do you have the receipt ?
<user> Yeah here you go . Actually I also want to return this keyboard .
<assistant> Ok . may I ask what is the reason for returning these products ?
<user> The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear .
<assistant> I see , and what about the keyboard ?
<user> I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work .
<assistant> I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages .
<user> Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways .

<user> There are so many people that the tickets are all sold out !
<assistant> Luckily we got the last two .
<user> Look , Danny . The Four Great Inventions !
<assistant> Gunpowder , compass , the paper making , and the printing .
<user> I really admire those who made such great inventions !
<assistant> May , I don't see why they are great . They are just simple things .
<user> They look simple today . But they were milestones in their times .
<assistant> Milestones ? May , you must be kidding .
<user> Just think Bill Gates , those inventions are as important as the windows system .
<assistant> Well , I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them .
<user> No , quite the contrary .
<assistant> Why ? Didn't you say that they were milestones ?
<user> Yes , but they went to the public without any patent protection .
<assistant> Well , their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates .

<user> What can I do for you ?
<assistant> I need some medicine .
<user> For whom ?
<assistant> My wife . She suffers from a bad cold .
<user> What symptoms does she have ?
<assistant> Fever and a bad cough .
<user> I see . Don't worry , just a common cold .
<assistant> What kind of medicine does she need ?
<user> Patulin will be enough .
<assistant> How many pills for each time ?
<user> Nine pills per day , and three pills after each meal .
<assistant> Thank you very much .
<user> It's my pleasure .

<user> Do you believe in god ?
<assistant> Not at all . I ' m an agnostic . do you ?
<user> I ' m not sure . Why don ' t you believe there is a god ?
<assistant> I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one .
<user> I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ' t explained yet .
<assistant> I ' m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong .
<user> For example ?
<assistant> Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics .
<user> Yes . Such people don ' t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs .

<user> Didn't you say your friend was American ? Where is she going on her honeymoon ?
<assistant> They're going skiing in Colorado .
<user> What a coincidence ! These pajamas would be perfect to take along on the honeymoon !
<assistant> You're probably right . Oh , what the heck ! I'll take it all ... in maroon , like you said .

<user> What a terrible house !
<assistant> I'm sick of it , too .
<user> The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart .
<assistant> It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out .
<user> Sure .

<user> Hello !
<assistant> Is that Sue ?
<user> Speaking .
<assistant> A.This is George .
<user> Hello , George.What ' s up ?

<user> This website offers very convenient air tickets booking service . It is quick and accurate .
<assistant> Yes , I once booked there . They give the immediate confirm information and flight information to both your mobile phone and e-mail . You can conveniently pay by credit card , so the whole transaction only takes a couple of minutes . They also provide e-tickets , meaning you don ' t need to go to any office to pick an air ticket . You go to the airport directly and check in with your ID card .
<user> So it has attracted more and more customers these days .
<assistant> Yes , therefore they are expanding the scope of their service . For example , hotels can be booked through the same site as well .

<user> Excuse me .
<assistant> Hello sir , may I help you ?
<user> Yes . Can I see that T-shirt on the top shelf please ?

<assistant> 50 dollars .
<user> 50 dollars . That's too much .
<assistant> How about this one ? It's on sale for only 35 dollars .
<user> I don't like that one .
<assistant> How about the one next to the black gloves ? It's very similar to the one you like .
<user> That's nice . How much is it ?
<assistant> 30 dollars .
<user> That'll be fine .
<assistant> Is this color OK , or would you like a different color ?
<user> That blue one's fine .
<assistant> Do you need any more of these shirts ?
<user> Yes .
<assistant> How many do you want ?
<user> I'll take two more , a red one and a white one .

<assistant> Thanks again . I will start on next Monday . I am sure I will have good performance .
<user> I agree .

<user> No , thank you . Goodbye .
<assistant> Goodbye .

<user> Hi there . Welcome to Lincoln Corporate Services . How can we help ?
<assistant> Hi . I was wondering what kind of fixed asset loans you have ? Do you have Fixed Asset Loans ?
<user> Yes , we do . You'll go through the acceptance application , then a first review , then an evaluation and examination and finally get approval . Why don't you read through this brochure ? It outlines all of the important aspects of the loan , the terms and conditions , etc .
<assistant> That's a good idea , to familiarise myself with it . Then , I'll be back if we decide to go ahead .

<user> There are many art craft items in this shop . I suggest you take your time , and you might find something you like .
<assistant> That's what I am going to do .
<user> If you have any problem , please come to me .
<assistant> I surely will . How much is this wood carving ?
<user> You are an expert on it . That wood carving is very rare . But I'm so sorry . that is not for sell .
<assistant> That's OK . Is anything else recommended ?
<user> Do you have any special request ?
<assistant> I'd like to see some traditional arts .
<user> So that means you are shopping for presents ?
<assistant> Yes , I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends .
<user> Actually , I think the paper-cuts is OK , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . They think that is a miracle .
<assistant> Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut .
<user> I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best .
<assistant> You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale .
<user> As a matter of fact , I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts . I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country .
<assistant> Wow , you are the expert on it .

<user> Operator . Can I help you ?
<assistant> I'd like to make a person-to-person call to Beijing , China . The number is 2135367 8 , and I want to speak to Mr . Zhang .
<user> To Mr . Zhang in at 2135-3678 ?
<assistant> Yes , that's right .
<user> May I have your name and telephone number ?
<assistant> My name is Luo Gang , and the phone number is 513-3284 .
<user> Mr . Luo , will you hold the line , please - - - Mr . Luo , there is no Zhang at that number . Will you check the number again , please ?
<assistant> What the number I gave you , operator ?
<user> It's 2135-3678 .
<assistant> Oh , I'm sorry . should have been 2135-3668 , not 3678 . I've given you a wrong number .
<user> Are you sure this time ?
<assistant> Yes .
<user> OK . Let me try again .
<assistant> Thank you .

<user> Are there any special requirements on the project ? And shall we talk around it in details ?
<assistant> Yes , there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it . Besides , you see , in recent years , we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness .
<user> That's a good idea . We can improve our technology to meet your special need .
<assistant> And please let white color dominate .
<user> OK ! I've noted it down . And any others ?
<assistant> Oh ! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city .

<user> Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery .
<assistant> Thanks a lot . And I believe I'll have a good time working with you .

<user> Mr . Black , I ' d like to take some time off . I ' Ve been feeling exhausted these days .
<assistant> That's no problem . Let me see ... You still have ten days annual leave left , is that right ?
<user> Yes . I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off .
<assistant> That's long leave . How's your project coming along ?
<user> The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on .
<assistant> Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave .

<assistant> Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed .
<user> I will . Many thanks , Mr.Black .

<user> Did you ever get a parking ticket ?
<assistant> Only a few .
<user> What's a few ?
<assistant> I've gotten six , I think .
<user> Did you pay your fines ?
<assistant> Of course I have .
<user> How much are the parking tickets ?
<assistant> I think they're  130 .
<user> That's expensive .
<assistant> I just got a parking ticket .
<user> You should probably pay the fine soon .
<assistant> I'm going to pay it today .

<user> Are you doing anything right now , Diana ?
<assistant> I am typing a report for the moment , Mr . Robbins . Anything I need to do ?
<user> Will you please cut it for a while and come in here to take a letter ?
<assistant> Is it urgent ?
<user> Yes , this letter can't go into the mail any later than 5 . It's about a contract .
<assistant> Ok , I am coming .
<user> Please take a seat , Diana . Have you got your spare pens and pencils ?
<assistant> Yes , I have this time . But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can I ask you halfway ?
<user> No , I ' d prefer not . I don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter .
<assistant> All right . I understand now . Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments .
<user> Of course , Diana . You'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it .
<assistant> Certainly I will , Mr . Robbins . By the way , may I use a window envelope ?
<user> Yes , that's fine . Now when you finish these , I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list .
<assistant> You want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names ?
<user> Right . And the last thing , we are going to clean the files out tomorrow . Now let's begin .

<user> You're finally here ! What took so long ?
<assistant> I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection .
<user> It's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
<assistant> I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest .
<user> perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work .
<assistant> I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good .
<user> It would be better for the environment , too .
<assistant> I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city .
<user> Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well .
<assistant> The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car .
<user> Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides .
<assistant> That's true . I could certainly use the exercise !
<user> So , are you going to quit driving to work then ?
<assistant> Yes , it's not good for me or for the environment .

<user> That's really convenient . We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent , though .
<assistant> I can take two thousand off . That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand .
<user> That's great . Every little bit counts . And we don't need the parking space . I guess we could rent it out .
<assistant> Sure , for at least three thousand per month .
<user> That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for .
<assistant> I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent .

<user> Hello . I sent out my laundry yesterday.Aren ' t they ready ?
<assistant> They'll be ready by this afternoon .
<user> Oh , no ! I'm leaving for Japan at 11 this morning .
<assistant> Is that right ? We're very sorry .
<user> I thought it was " the same day " service.Anyway , please do hurry .
<assistant> I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock .
<user> Well , then , would you send it to Japan , please ?
<assistant> Yes , we'll do so .

<user> Hello , welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ?
<assistant> I want to effect payment under an L  C today .
<user> No problem . OK ... just checking for you . Ah , I'm afraid there aren't enough funds in your account to cover this transaction . What you can do is buy some US dollars , using local currency and we can credit your account with that amount .
<assistant> That seems alright . What's the exchange rate like today ? Good or bad ?
<user> It's not too bad today , actually . 828.23 .

<user> How can I help you , sir ?
<assistant> I am here to have a discussion on your company's investment issue .
<user> Sorry , could you tell me your name ?
<assistant> I am James Pond from FAM Company and I am here to discuss it with Nova .
<user> Do you have an appointment ?
<assistant> Yes , I did it yesterday . Our meeting should be 2 pm .

<assistant> Thank you .
<user> She will be back soon .

<user> Excuse me . Would you please make a suit with this material ?
<assistant> Sure . May I take your measurements ?
<user> Please don't make it too tight . This is for autumn wear , so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath .
<assistant> I see , sir . Can you come back for a fitting on the 10th , that's in a week's time ?
<user> The 10th ? I'm sorry , but you see I'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th . Could you have the suit ready by the 8th , or at the latest , the 9th ?
<assistant> Well , a business suit usually takes ten days ' time . But in your case , we'll try to have it ready sooner . How about coming for your fitting on the 8th ? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th ?
<user> That's fine , thank you .

<user> It seems that many boys are fighting there .
<assistant> Break it up ! I will not permit fighting in this campus .

<user> the air quality in this city is horrendous ! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again !
<assistant> exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment .
<user> on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
<assistant> as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health .
<user> I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse
<assistant> what is the greenhouse effect exactly ?
<user> it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .
<assistant> I see , so it's similar to global warming ?
<user> they're related to one another , yes .
<assistant> I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live .
<user> people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .
<assistant> people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .
<user> I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place .

<user> Would you like some cookies ? I just made them .
<assistant> Thank you . Yes , I would .
<user> These are chocolate , and those are almond-flavored .
<assistant> I guess I'll try a chocolate one first.Mmmm ... this is delicious.Are they hard to make ?
<user> No , they're really quite easy . Wait a minute , I've got the recipe right here.See ... these are the ingredients , and then you just follow the directions .
<assistant> That does look easy . I think I'll make some tonight .

<user> Can I help you ?
<assistant> I'd like to buy a ticket to Casablanca on flight US125 tomorrow .
<user> Hold on , plese.It will take off at 14:00 tomorrow.The price is  110 .
<assistant> Well , I want to stay under  100 .
<user> I am sorry Sir . We won't give any discount in busy seasons.The price is the same .

<user> How do you use an ATM card , Billy ?
<assistant> It ' s easy grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . Ok . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers .
<user> Oh yes . I ' Ve got it written down here . Just a minute .
<assistant> You really shouldn ' t write it down . You should memorise it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like .
<user> Ok , I ' Ve entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don ' t I ?
<assistant> Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want .
<user> I can just enter the amount using the key , right ?
<assistant> That ' s right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money .
<user> These machines aren ' t very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk .

<user> Hello , is Jennifer in ?
<assistant> I am sorry , you have the wrong number .
<user> Oh , I am really sorry .

<user> Can you give me a hand with the dishes ?
<assistant> Sure . Should I wash or dry ?
<user> I wash and you'll dry .
<assistant> OK . Let's do it .

<user> Excuse me , do you have the latest issue of Newsworld ?
<assistant> Yes , this week's issue just came in . Here it is .
<user> How about Music Madness ?
<assistant> Let me check ... yes , we got the October issue a few days ago . It's on that shelf over there .
<user> Okay , I'll take these two magazines and a copy of Today's Post .

<user> Good afternoon , Miss . What can I do for you ?
<assistant> Could you tell me my account balance ? My account number is ...
<user> Just a moment , please . Your name ?

<user> Yes , we have .

<user> You look great ! How do you stay in such good shape ?
<assistant> Well , I go jogging every morning , eat a healthful diet and work out in a gymnasium twice a week .

<user> 2,000 AD  .
<assistant> Which would you like to remit , by mail or by cable ?
<user> What is the difference between them ?

<user> Well , I think the cable is better .
<assistant> OK , please fill in the application form giving the name and address of beneficiary , your name and telephone .
<user> All right . Here you are .
<assistant> Everything is OK . The commission is 50 yuan .
<user> Here you are . Thanks a lot .

<assistant> Why ?
<user> This channel has so many advertisements , and it doesn't have any good TV programs .
<assistant> OK . You can change it .
<user> What about this one ? Do you like this program ?
<assistant> No , I think it is very boring . Can you change it to Channel Twelve , please ?
<user> Yes . Oh , it's a talk show .
<assistant> Yeah , it's very funny . Have you ever watched it before ?
<user> No , I haven't . This is my first time to watch it .
<assistant> I'm sure you will like it .

<user> Excuse me , is there any summer resort around the town ?
<assistant> As far as I know , the nearest one is next to the Willdon .
<user> It doesn't matter . I just want to have a relax and I don't care how far it is . Can you tell me how to get there ?
<assistant> Yes , take the greyhound bus . It will lead you directly there .
<user> Thanks a billion .

<user> Every honored guests , welcome to Hang Thou . Now we are visiting Tiger-running Spring .
<assistant> How can we relate tiger to this spot , Miss Zhang ?

<user> Will you ask him to call me collect when he ' s back ?
<assistant> Certainly . May I ask who ' s calling , please ?
<user> Yes , this is Cindy Wang of A  B Trading Company in New York .

<user> I'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too title .
<assistant> I'm not sure I can't agree , dan
<user> Why not ?
<assistant> Surely , there are other ways to save money .

<user> Hi , Customer Service Desk . What can I do for you today , sir ?
<assistant> Good morning . I bought this vacuum here a few months ago . It doesn ' t work now . Can I return it or get it fixed ?

<assistant> Then , why didn't you do that ?
<user> I don't know how much we can trust them . Do you have any ideas ?
<assistant> Some of them , I think , are not good .

<assistant> No . You can go to the Bank of China to exchange some US dollars at the current exchange rate of the day you exchange them . The maximum amount you can exchange is  2,000 .
<user> Only  2,000 ? Are there any other ways to get the money exchanged ?

<user> can you squeeze me in sometime today ?

<user> I know what you ' re saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy .
<assistant> Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? It won ' t take more than a half hour , will it ?

<user> You seem to be upset . What ' s eating you ?
<assistant> It ' s because of my son . Dick keeps getting on my nerves
<user> Dick ? How come ? He used to be as meek as a lamb .
<assistant> Yes , he used to be . But now he ' s drifting off track .
<user> He must have been in bad company , or he wouldn ' t be off the beans .

<user> Bring me some toast , please .
<assistant> Would you like butter or jam on your toast or do you just want it plain ?
<user> Spread some jam , please .
<assistant> Anything to drink ?
<user> Black coffee is fine .

<assistant> i'm afraid i can't dance well .

<user> Well , it's illegal to bring food and drinks into the theater .
<assistant> Too bad . I did anyway .
<user> No wonder you brought such a big bag today .
<assistant> I brought Strawberry Sticks . See ?
<user> Those are the ones that are pre-dipped in sweet coating !
<assistant> Yep . And there's real strawberry chunks in the coating .

<user> I think that you look very cute today .
<assistant> Is that right ? This is a brand new outfit .
<user> What store did you get it from ?
<assistant> I went to Macy's and picked it out .
<user> I love your outfit right now .

<assistant> Your shoes look really nice . How much did you get them for ?
<user> They only cost me about forty dollars .
<assistant> I'm going to go get a pair for myself .

<user> What can I do for you ?
<assistant> I'd like to be waken up tomorrow morning .

<user> Jog ?
<assistant> Then , you are to walk to work .

<user> Oh , dear .
<assistant> And three times a week , you can either swim , play racketball , or hand ball .
<user> Oh no .
<assistant> OK , you can stop now.It ' s time for the dance class .
<user> Dance class ! I don't know how .

<user> Sandy , can you help me contact these people ?
<assistant> Sure , what do you want me to tell them ?
<user> Well , I need to confirm the time of their classes .
<assistant> Ok , where can I find their telephone number ?
<user> They are all listed here on this sheet of paper .
<assistant> Is it their home , office or cell phone numbers ?
<user> Unless it ' s marked differently , it ' s their home numbers .
<assistant> Alright . What if I can ' t get a hold of them by phone ?
<user> Then , you should e-mail them with the information .
<assistant> Where can I find their e-mail addresses ?
<user> They should have then listed on their resumes .
<assistant> And if there aren ' t any e-mail addresses ?
<user> Then send them a SMS on their cell phone .
<assistant> Ok . That sounds easy enough . Have you called any of them yet ?
<user> Yes . I called the first three people on the list , but they didn ' t pick up .
<assistant> Did you leave a voice message ?
<user> I left a voice message on one---just for the first person on the list .
<assistant> I see . What did you tell her ?
<user> I told her that she should call me back at my office number .
<assistant> Ok , so , maybe I should call her again .
<user> Yes , that sounds like a good idea . She might not get the other message in time .
<assistant> One more question . It looks like some of these numbers are long-distance . Do you have a calling card that I can use to get through to them ?
<user> Sure . You can use this one . The pin number is written on the back of the card .
<assistant> Alright . Thanks a lot . Don ' t worry . I ' ll take care of it .

<assistant> It is 15 minutes ' drive .

<user> The environment varies greatly because of difference in language , customs and traditions .
<assistant> Yes . This gap can be filled by export market research before exporting .
<user> But the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers .
<assistant> That's right . They do not appreciate its value and consider it to be a luxury .
<user> Therefore , when enterprises are spending a lot of money in trying to penetrate a new market , they should research whether their products can be sold at high enough a price and in a satisfactory amount .
<assistant> Exactly !

<user> You are obligated to maintain your building and my apartment .
<assistant> I will fix these problems when I get around to it .

<user> I ' m thinking about getting a pet , but I ' m really not sure which animal would be suitable . Could you give me some advice ?
<assistant> Certainly ! The first thing is to be honest about how much time for you can devote to your pet . Dogs are very demanding . You need to take them for walks and they love to play . Cats , on the other hand , are more independent .
<user> I ' m fairly busy , so I really need an animal that I don ' t need to care of very much . Actually , I ' d like a pet that ' s a little unusual . I don't ' really want a typical pet , like a cat , dog , or hamster . Do you have any suggestions ?
<assistant> Unusual pet are often more expensive to keep . Is that a problem ?
<user> Not really . By the way , I don ' t want a pet that could be dangerous , like a tarantula or rattlesnake .
<assistant> We have those , but I only sell them to people I know well , for obvious reasons . How about a lizard ? I have some that are very brightly coloured , are not aggressive , and are easy to feed and look after .
<user> That sounds ideal . Could you show me some ?
<assistant> Sure . Come over here . As you can see , I have a wide selection of species . They can live together , if you want lizards of different kinds . Do you have a favourite colour ?
<user> I like the red one . What do they eat ?
<assistant> You can feed them on various things . They will eat small pieces of meat , but I ' d recommend insects . You can get them from your garden , but remember that lizards eat a lot insects . I sell them here .
<user> Thanks a lot . What I ' ll do si find out more online and drop by next week .
<assistant> That ' s fine . You shouldn ' t make a hasty decision when choosing a pet .

<user> How do you like your overcoat , sir ?
<assistant> It's a bit too large . Would you please shorten the sleeves ?
<user> OK , no problem . Let me take your measurement .
<assistant> Besides , can you take up the hem one inch ?
<user> Fine .

<user> We need a person who knows how to operate and repair all kinds of office appliances .
<assistant> I used to hold a similar job for six years .
<user> So you're quite confident in your experience and skill
<assistant> I think so .

<user> Yes , sir.May I help you ?
<assistant> Please I'd like a ticket to New York .
<user> For today ?
<assistant> No , early saturday morning .
<user> We have a flight that we'll put you there at ten AM.Is that ok ?
<assistant> Nothing earlier ? I prefer flight at nine thirty .
<user> I'm afraid not , unless you want a night flight .
<assistant> No , exactly not

<user> What may I help you with ?
<assistant> I need to file a complaint .
<user> What is your complaint about ?

<user> What was taken ?
<assistant> My wallet and cell phone .

<user> Would you able to pick him out of a line-up ?
<assistant> That shouldn't be a problem .

<user> Dad , I ' d like to borrow some money .
<assistant> Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ?
<user> Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ' m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg .
<assistant> I don ' t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ' t know if you ' re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ' s just too much instability . I wouldn ' t feel comfortable investing in this climate .
<user> But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.And anyway , I ' m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example.they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .
<assistant> Come on , son , you ' re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point .
<user> Fine , then ! If that ' s the way you feel , so be it . But you ' re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ' m going to go hit up Mum for the cash .

<user> Could you tell me a little about the organization ? For example , how big is your workforce here ?
<assistant> Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff .
<user> I see . And how about the working hours ?
<assistant> Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times .
<user> Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ' s not really a shock for me .
<assistant> Good , as long as you understand that .
<user> And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ?
<assistant> Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month .
<user> That sounds ideal .

<user> Smells good ! What ' s for breakfast ?
<assistant> Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast !
<user> Nice ! Brunch !
<assistant> Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
<user> Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ?
<assistant> Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
<user> Looks good ! I ' ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
<assistant> Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ' t forget the syrup !

<user> Come on , fellows . Let's enjoy my wife's cooking !
<assistant> Em , it's delicious !
<user> Thank you ! My wife likes cooking very much .
<assistant> You're lucky .

<assistant> I want to prove my true value in the electronic industry , and hopefully in the near future I would be promoted to a higher position .

<user> Linda , would you care for some candies or cookies ?
<assistant> No , don't try to tempt me . I'm becoming chubby , and I have to slim down .
<user> You are not really chubby . You are actually thin enough .
<assistant> I don't think so . I know I've put on weight this winter .
<user> So you are watching your weight , aren't you ?
<assistant> Yes , to tell you the truth . I am on a diet .

<user> How about your grades of study ?
<assistant> I had been doing quite well . In all subjects , I got excellent scores .

<user> Is she really ?
<assistant> She is absolutely wonderful .
<user> So she isn't causing you any problems ?
<assistant> No . She is actually very intelligent and well behaved .
<user> I'm glad to know that you like her .
<assistant> You have nothing to worry about with her .

<user> Good afternoon , ladies . May I help you ?
<assistant> Can we have two adjoining double rooms , sir ?
<user> Have you made a reservation , ladies ?
<assistant> I'm afraid not .
<user> One moment , please . I have to check if there are rooms available . I'm sorry , ladies . We have only two double rooms available but they are on different floors . Would you mind that ?
<assistant> We prefer on the same floor because we will probably chat late at night .
<user> Then may I suggest a family suite ? We have just had a cancellation .
<assistant> What is it like ?
<user> It's a big room with a king-size double bed and two single beds . We could also add rollaways .
<assistant> That's great ! How much is it ?
<user> Two thousand hongkong dollars per night plus ten percent service charge and five percent government government tax .
<assistant> That's fine .

<user> Nice to meet you , sir . I come from New Times Clothes Company . We learnt that your exhibits on the Trade Fair in Shanghai this month were marvelous . Would you please quote the price ?
<assistant> Before we discuss the price , may I ask you what kind of exhibits you are interested in ?
<user> Your summer clothes for white-collar and men's jackets .
<assistant> Can you give us a rough idea of the quantity you require ? It is generally known that the price varies according to the quantity .
<user> That is to say , 10000 sets for the one of white-collar and 5000 for men's jackets .

<user> Please try the shop there . They might have them .
<assistant> Are their cards free , too ?
<user> No , their cards are for sale .

<user> So what do you think of my new dress ?
<assistant> I think it ' s great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I ' Ve actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine ' s for a while now , but I wasn ' t sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment .
<user> Um , ninety-five dollars ?
<assistant> Yes , that ' s the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ?
<user> I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen ' s Boutique . I didn ' t know I could get it cheaper somewhere else .
<assistant> Of course ! Everything at Helen ' s is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn ' t you shop around ?
<user> I don ' t know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive .

<user> Long time no see , George !
<assistant> Yes , a very long time .
<user> What brings you here ?
<assistant> I'm here on vacation .

<user> David , how is your interview ?
<assistant> I was nervous at that time . What about you ?
<user> Just fine . I tried to answer every question raised by HR carefully . I found some answering skills are useful . These questions are different from exams .
<assistant> We can have a rest now after this tough interview .
<user> Don't be rush . It is suggested to write a letter for the Personnel Department of Future Clothes Company .
<assistant> Sounds like a good idea . And I think this can leave deep impression to HR . How can we write a suitable letter ?
<user> Just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company . And you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you .
<assistant> I am getting to know your meaning .

<user> Good morning , I made an appointment with Dr . Smith , but I have to change it .
<assistant> When you made your appointment , what day did you choose ?

<assistant> What's the charge ?
<user> Well , it depends how many pieces of luggages you have .
<assistant> Thank you .

<user> Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ?
<assistant> Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ' s showing your respect to your co-workers .
<user> Well , but for this one , don ' t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ?
<assistant> Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion .
<user> I didn ' t pay attention to that .

<user> Do you think we should travel by bus or by train ?
<assistant> It's a difficult choice.The train is a little faster , but much more expensive .
<user> We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams .
<assistant> Buses are more cramps and you can't walk around .
<user> That's true.But I feel that I see more when I travel by bus .
<assistant> Really ? I think you see more traveling by train .
<user> So which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
<assistant> I prefer going by train , even though it costs more .
<user> Ok , then we'll go by train . I'm sure we'll have a good journey.Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ?
<assistant> The trains aren't usually full.We can get them on the day we travel.We should buy return tickets , because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles .
<user> We should take a packed lunch on the journey.The food they sell on the trains is always expensive .

<user> Did you hear about Lulu ?
<assistant> No , what ?
<user> She and Vic broke up and now she ' s asked for a transfer .
<assistant> Get out of here ! I didn ' t even know they were dating !
<user> No one really did . They were very discreet and professional at the office .

<user> Here's a model of our latest design . What do you think of it ?
<assistant> Well , I'm not too happy about it .
<user> What's wrong with it ?
<assistant> Well , I'm afraid it's not at all what I wanted . You haven't really followed my instructions.It ' ll have to be done again .
<user> Oh , dear !

<user> Hello , this is the International Youth Hotel . How can I help you ?
<assistant> oh , yes . I want to check whether you still have any vacancies . I need three single rooms for next Monday .

<assistant> yes , please . Do you take credit cards ?
<user> yes , we accept all major credit cards .

<user> yes , breakfast is included and parking is available .
<assistant> fantastic . Thank you very much .
<user> you're welcome . And we have 24 hour reception . Please don't hesitate to call anytime if you have any further questions .

<user> I have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . I feel exhausted .
<assistant> You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard .
<user> You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ' t sleep well . What ' s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation .

<user> What sort of shopping is nearby , Mr . Taylor ?
<assistant> Call me John . This is a great area of the city for shopping . There ' s a grocery store just around the corner .
<user> What about things other than food ?
<assistant> Well , the Riverside Mall has 200 stores in it , including four major department stores .
<user> Are there small shops near here as well ?
<assistant> Yes , on 4th street , near the movie theater there are many specialty shops , including clothing boutiques .
<user> Well , that sounds just wonderful .
<assistant> Yes , it ' s a really nice neighborhood .

<user> Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it .
<assistant> Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know.Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more .
<user> But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished .
<assistant> But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely .
<user> Well , only you liked it really , darling .
<assistant> Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy .

<user> Hi , Bob , everything okay ?
<assistant> More or less . There's just one thing bothering me .
<user> Oh ? What's that ?
<assistant> Well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
<user> What gift ?
<assistant> It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it .
<user> You refused the gift ? That's terrible .
<assistant> I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way .
<user> Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
<assistant> That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .

<user> I've been looking for a swimming pool , but I haven't found one yet .
<assistant> We have no pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in our gym .
<user> Swim stations ? Could you be a little more explicit ?
<assistant> You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere ? Well , it's the same thing .
<user> Gee , that's a great idea . Now , how much do I have to pay ?
<assistant> The stations are absolutely free to guests , sir .
<user> Great ! Now , when can I go down there and use the stations ?
<assistant> The swim stations are open daily from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m .
<user> Boy , oh boy ! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks .
<assistant> Be warned , sir . At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded .

<user> Hi . Today , I am the interviewer for your visa application .
<assistant> OK . Here is my application form and all the documents .
<user> Can you tell me why do you want a visa to America ?
<assistant> Because I want to have a view of the exotic landscapes to extend my views and understanding of the world .
<user> OK . Do you plan to go to America all by yourself or with your family ?
<assistant> Myself .
<user> Have you finished all you preparation ?
<assistant> Yes . Everything is ready .

<user> What a pity you are leaving so soon . I wish you could stay a few more days . Sir , can you deliver a speech for us ?
<assistant> Dear friends . Here , I wish to say a word of thanks for holding this send-off party for me . Actually I didn't expect at all for this . I owe a lot to all of you here .

<assistant> Madam , we also welcome you to visit our company . I hope you can also bring your family there to have a look of our company . In this way , we will know each other better .
<user> Definitely ! Thank you !

<assistant> I have time to speak with you . Where would you like to purchase your house ?
<user> I am most interested in Pasadena or Arcadia , but would be open to other suggestions .
<assistant> How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need ?
<user> We have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home .
<assistant> Do you need to be located in a particular school district ?
<user> It doesn ' t matter , as we do not have any children .
<assistant> Is a view important to you , or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot ?
<user> In a perfect world , we would like a home with a view of the lake .

<assistant> I'm ready now . I'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn .
<user> And would you like an appetizer before your meal ? The soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup .
<assistant> I'll pass on the soup , but I'd like a garden salad .
<user> Can I get you anything to drink ?
<assistant> Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea .
<user> Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
<assistant> Thank you .

<user> What is your salary at present ?
<assistant> My present pay is 100,000 Yuan per year .
<user> What are your salary expectations now ?
<assistant> I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 120,000 Yuan per year .
<user> That's a little more than we had planned .
<assistant> I think you'll find I'm worth that .
<user> I can only offer you 110,000 Yuan a year . Raises will be given after a three-month probation according to your performance . Is that satisfactory ?
<assistant> Yes , it is quite reasonable .

<assistant> Amalgamated Trading Company . It's Swiss . Don't you think working at a foreign company would be glamorous ?
<user> Yeah , I guess so . I've never actually heard of this one , but ...
<assistant> Well , it's small , but it's a young , dynamic , rapidly-growing company with a progressive , humanistic philosophy .
<user> You didn't read their brochure or anything , did you ?
<assistant> Four times . I'm totally prepared . Oh , no ! I forgot to take off my nail polish ! And I have to be there in 15 minutes ! That's it . I blew it .
<user> Well , they are progressive and humanistic-maybe they don't care about nail polish ... uh ... even blue nail polish . Just keep your confidence up and you'll do great .
<assistant> But the competition is fierce this year ... and it seems like I'm the only one left who hasn't found a job .

<assistant> A teriyaki bowl sounds nice .
<user> I don't know how to make that .
<assistant> All you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef .
<user> That sounds fairly simple , but how do I cook it ?
<assistant> The first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice .
<user> What's next ?
<assistant> Then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it .
<user> What's the next thing I need to do ?
<assistant> Then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy .

<user> I'm sorry , sir . I can't interrupt her . I'm sure she won't be very long .

<user> Yes , certainly .
<assistant> Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her ?
<user> Yes , sir . I'll ring her on an inside line if you like .

<assistant> Wait a moment . Here you are .
<user> By the way , we would like to order some dishes for my friend .
<assistant> Sure .

<user> Can you help me out , Chuck ?
<assistant> Sure . What's it , Yvonne ?
<user> I want to put my desk over there , but it's too heavy for me to move .
<assistant> Okay , you take one end and I'll take the other .

<user> Good morning . Madam . What can I do for you today ?
<assistant> Hello . I hope you can help me ; I'm a little worried about my new card .
<user> What seems to be the problem ?
<assistant> I received my new card this morning , but I'm unable to use it .
<user> Oh ? You mean , the ATM machine has eaten it ?
<assistant> No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it !
<user> You said you received your card this morning , am I right ?
<assistant> Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ?
<user> Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons .
<assistant> Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me .

<user> Can you manage chopsticks ?
<assistant> Why not ? See .
<user> Good mastery . How do you like our Chinese food ?
<assistant> Oh , great ! It's delicious . You see , I am already putting on weight . There is one thing I don't like however , MSG .
<user> What's wrong with MSG ? It helps to bring out the taste of the food .
<assistant> According to some studies it may cause cancer .
<user> Oh , don't let that worry you . If that were true , China wouldn't have such a large population .
<assistant> I just happen to have a question for you guys . Why do the Chinese cook the vegetables ? You see what I mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated .
<user> I don't know exactly . It's a tradition . Maybe it's for sanitary reasons .

<user> Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ?
<assistant> It was a nightmare .
<user> What ' s up ?
<assistant> Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
<user> Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ?
<assistant> Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout .
<user> This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ?
<assistant> I am still waiting for their call .
<user> Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward .

<user> Do you have any seat preferences , sir ?
<assistant> Yes , could you put me in the no-smoking section ?
<user> Yes . Would you like a window seat ?
<assistant> If one's available , please . But not over the wing .

<user> morning . Rent-A-Car Agency . May I help you ?
<assistant> Good morning . This is Paul Alexander calling from the Isis Advertising Firm . We need a car to the airport for Mr . Phillips .
<user> Certainly , Mr . Alexander . When would Mr . Phillips like to leave ?
<assistant> Let me check ... His flight ' s at 2:30 p . m . , so he should leave no later than 12 noon .

<user> I'm calling today about a bill that I never received .
<assistant> Can you tell me which credit card it was for ?
<user> It was for my Master Card .
<assistant> You should've gotten that bill two weeks ago .
<user> I haven't got it in the mail yet .
<assistant> The computer is showing that all bills have been mailed .
<user> What am I supposed to do about my bill then ?
<assistant> Maybe you should call your post office .
<user> But if it's their mistake , can I get an extension on my bill payment ?
<assistant> Yes , but you will need to send us proof of their mistake .
<user> Okay , thank you very much for your help .
<assistant> Not a problem . Enjoy the rest of your day .

<user> Jenny , don't you think it's really charming ?
<assistant> Yes . It's a feast of eyes to walking in the museum .
<user> Let's take our time and enjoy the art and sprite of the famous museum .
<assistant> What a shame that we can't take pictures .

<user> OK , Allen . It's your turn . Are you ready ?
<assistant> I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ?
<user> Come on ! In the two hours we've been here you haven't sung even one song !
<assistant> I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night .
<user> Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him . He loves " The King . "
<assistant> I'll put the song at the front of the list .

<user> Here is the document you asked for this morning .
<assistant> Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks .
<user> You ' re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later .
<assistant> This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ?
<user> The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
<assistant> Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ' t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do .

<user> How are you doing , Jim ?
<assistant> Fine , just fine.How about you ?
<user> Not too bad .

<user> I think your presentation impressed the client , Daniel . You did a good job .
<assistant> Thank you , Mr . Cooper . I hope we get the contract .

<user> What's for lunch ?
<assistant> Pork chops .

<user> What happened to you ?
<assistant> I think I caught a cold .
<user> Do you have any symptoms ?
<assistant> Runny nose and coughing .
<user> Do you have a fever ?
<assistant> I have just taken the temperature , I don't think so .
<user> It's not serious .
<assistant> Are you sure ?
<user> Yes .
<assistant> What should I do ?
<user> You should drink more hot water , and do some exercise .

<user> What kind of place shall we rent ?
<assistant> It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .
<user> Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .
<assistant> Neither am I . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area .
<user> I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
<assistant> Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
<user> Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
<assistant> How much do you think the rent will be ?
<user> I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .

<user> I don't think we can meet the delivery date you suggest . It's too soon .
<assistant> Well , is it possible for you to effect shipment by the middle of June ?
<user> The earliest we can do is by the end of June .

<user> Did you have any working experience during college ?
<assistant> Yes , I did some part-time jobs such as English tutor , salesman , and model .
<user> What did you learn from your part-time jobs ?
<assistant> I learned to be patient , professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .

<user> Smells good ! What ' s for breakfast ?
<assistant> Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast !
<user> Nice ! Brunch !
<assistant> Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
<user> Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ?
<assistant> Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
<user> Looks good ! I ' ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
<assistant> Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ' t forget the syrup !

<user> Can you tell me if there is a flight to New York ?
<assistant> Yes . Flight DB117 departs at 5:38 pm and arrives in New York at 6:00 am with a layover in Chicago . It also makes a refueling stop at Colombia .
<user> So many stops ! Don't you have any direct flights ?
<assistant> Sorry sir , it is the only flight wa have right now .

<user> Hello.Hot water overflowed from the bathtub.Will you help me ?
<assistant> Would you turn off the tap ?
<user> I did it .
<assistant> Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door ?
<user> OK . I will .
<assistant> I'll have our housekeeper come right away .
<user> I'm sorry I was too tired to fall asleep .
<assistant> When you woke up , the water was coming out of the tub .
<user> Right.Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ?

<user> Would you like some more coffee ?
<assistant> No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill .
<user> The waitress is bringing the bill right now .
<assistant> This waitress has really been on top of things , hasn't she ?
<user> Yes , this waitress did a great job .
<assistant> OK , let's see what the damage is . The total for our meal is  36.00 .
<user> What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ?
<assistant> Fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . What do you think about 20  this time ?
<user> Yes , 20  would be perfect .
<assistant> Her tip will end up being  7.20 plus the bill of  36.00 . The total will be  43.20 .
<user> Yes , that was one fantastic meal !
<assistant> I agree . Maybe we can come back again next week .

<user> It ' s time for me to go now .
<assistant> Would you like me to go with you ?
<user> I ' d rather you stayed in the office and did these things .
<assistant> Do you want to type that letter ?
<user> I ' d rather you typed it .
<assistant> Do you want to tell her ?
<user> I ' d rather you told her .

<user> Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head .
<assistant> What crime did I commit ?
<user> You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs , so we are taking you into custody . We ' Ve found some heroin in your house . You have the following rights while you are being interviewed . You have the right to remain silent . You don't have to make any statement against your will . You have the right to defense counsel . You have the right to request an investigation of evidence favorable to your case . Do you understand your rights ?
<assistant> I am innocent .

<user> Would you like to come by and play bridge ?
<assistant> Well , let's see . Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time .
<user> Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired .
<assistant> Hmm . Well , in that case , we could go to the movies .
<user> Oh , we always go to the movies . Can't we do something different ?
<assistant> Well , do you have any suggestions ?
<user> Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ?
<assistant> It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things .
<user> Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
<assistant> OK .
<user> Hello , Janet . It's me ... Oh , fine . Just fine . Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ?

<user> Tom , it's time for you to go to bed .
<assistant> Good night , mum .
<user> Good night .

<user> Operator . May I help you ?
<assistant> Yes . How do I get an outside line , please ?
<user> Just dial 0 , wait for the dial tone , and then dial the phone number you want to call . Or we can place a call for you , if you want .
<assistant> No , thanks a lot . I'll try it myself .

<user> What's our target audience for this campaign ?
<assistant> This go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two .
<user> Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ?
<assistant> Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here .
<user> Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ?
<assistant> Demographics say an average age of 28.7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year .

<user> John , I'd like to see you in my office for a minute .
<assistant> Yes , sir , I'll be there in just a moment .
<user> John , I have been watching you . I've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and I'm impressed . You've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts . I just want to let you to know , after this month's performance reviews , I'm recommending you for promotion .
<assistant> Gosh sir , thank you , sir ! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department .
<user> Well , it's not going to be in our department . I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . There's supervisory spot opening up in financial . I'm turning your name in for it .
<assistant> Management ? Wow , I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff .
<user> You've earned it .

<user> How can I help you today ?
<assistant> I am returning something that I bought yesterday .
<user> What would you like to return ?
<assistant> I'm returning a cellphone .
<user> Was there something wrong with it ?
<assistant> It's defective .
<user> What isn't working on it ?
<assistant> It keeps turning off on it's own .
<user> Alright , do you have the receipt ?
<assistant> I have it right here .
<user> I'm going to take care of this and refund your money .
<assistant> Thanks for your help .

<user> I miss grandma . I dreamed about her yesterday .
<assistant> Dear , let ' s drop the subject .

<user> Good morning , sir . Can I help you ?
<assistant> Good morning . I'd like to cash this check .
<user> Yes , sir . Can you show you identity ?
<assistant> What about the driving license ?
<user> Don't you have any other identification ?
<assistant> I am sorry . I only have my driving license with me .
<user> Ok . Would you please sign your name on the back of the check ?
<assistant> Thank you . Here you are .
<user> How do you want your money ?
<assistant> Would you give me some in twenties and tens ?
<user> All right . Please wait for a moment .

<user> Could you fill in this form , please ?
<assistant> All right .
<user> Have you got any identification ?
<assistant> Yes , here's my ID card .

<user> Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !
<assistant> What ? What did you buy ?
<user> It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !
<assistant> What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?
<user> There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick .
<assistant> And ?
<user> So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .
<assistant> And it's a brick ?
<user> Yes .
<assistant> I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?
<user> I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .
<assistant> So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .
<user> Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .
<assistant> But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?
<user> He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .
<assistant> Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !
<user> C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .
<assistant> That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .
<user> You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?

<user> Hello , Arthur . What seems to be the problem ?
<assistant> Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I ' m getting headaches , and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 2020 vision .
<user> Sounds like you may be far-sighted . OK , then , cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you .
<assistant> Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ' t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ' s the peace sign .
<user> Wow , Arthur ! You ' re as blind as a bat !
<assistant> Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times .
<user> Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription .
<assistant> Thanks doc !
<user> Arthur , that ' s the bathroom .

<user> Would you like some more coffee ?
<assistant> No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill .
<user> Good luck finding the waitress !
<assistant> The service this evening has kind of sucked . Is that our server over there ?
<user> I'll go get the check , since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way .
<assistant> Good . I'll just stay here until you get back .
<user> So the total is  36.00 for our dinner .
<assistant> How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ?
<user> I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service .
<assistant> I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight .
<user> I think that we should leave 10  .
<assistant>  3.60 will be the right amount for the tip .

<user> I want to fly to Congo on Monday , the 17th .
<assistant> Let me see what's available .

<assistant> Africa Airline 551 leaves at 9:00 pm .
<user> That's fine . I want to pay in cash . Here is the money .

<user> How much was your watch ?
<assistant> Take a guess .

<user> A guy in my office got the flu the other day . Today I seem to have come down with it , too .
<assistant> Very likely . You have a slight fever . Do you have a headache , too ?
<user> Yes . I wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon , because I'll be on a business trip in two days .
<assistant> Well , you have to let your flu run its course . You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery .
<user> But I'm going on a business trip in two days !
<assistant> Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it . If you go out while you are sick , it won't help you recover . You may even pass your disease on to others .

<user> Would you care for a drink ?
<assistant> No , thanks . I'm fine .

<user> Let's go practice your driving .
<assistant> If that's what you want to do , then we can .

<assistant> What do you want me to do ?
<user> Go left .
<assistant> How far should I go ?
<user> I'll let you know when I want you to stop .
<assistant> Tell me before you want me to stop .
<user> All right , try parking here .
<assistant> Thanks . Let's go driving again tomorrow .

<user> How may I help you ?

<user> Here you go .

<assistant> I absolutely love the apartment .
<user> Everything is okay ?
<assistant> I do have one problem with the apartment .
<user> What ' s the problem ?
<assistant> I don ' t like all those stains in the carpet .
<user> We will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment .
<assistant> I did not know that .
<user> I assure you that we will , and if there are any more problems , feel free to tell me .
<assistant> That was the only thing that I saw wrong with the apartment .
<user> I ' m glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice .
<assistant> It ' s absolutely incredible . I ' ll take it .

<user> Come in , Arnold . Have a seat .
<assistant> Good morning .
<user> Would you like something to drink ?
<assistant> No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk .
<user> So , you're a serious coffee drinker .
<assistant> Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted .
<user> Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing.Everyone has to have something.For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ?
<assistant> No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker .
<user> Well , what would you like to talk to me about ?
<assistant> I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal .
<user> I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it .
<assistant> It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday .
<user> Yes .
<assistant> Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here .
<user> What do you suggest ?
<assistant> The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation .
<user> You mean because people have to go across town to get here .
<assistant> Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road .
<user> That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them .
<assistant> I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them .
<user> I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that .
<assistant> Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more .
<user> Well .
<assistant> I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that .
<user> You mean you want to run the meetings ?
<assistant> No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better .
<user> Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks .
<assistant> I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized .
<user> I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works .
<assistant> Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it .
<user> I will call the managers.Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this " new style . "

<user> Do you have a good English-Chinese dictionary ?
<assistant> Sure . How about this one ?

<assistant> The hardcover is more expensive .
<user> Oh ! I see . I'll have the paperback , please .

<assistant> No , and I don ' t usually get a lot of stomachaches .

<user> May I help you ?
<assistant> Yes , I would like to exchange some money .
<user> what currency would you like to trade in ?

<user> No problem , we can accept any denomination . How much would you like to exchange today ?
<assistant> Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ?
<user> It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7.45RMB.If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7.35.Will that be all right ?
<assistant> I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow !

<assistant> There are four more stops .

<user> Because I need to use the restroom . Is there a restroom on the train ?
<assistant> No , not on the train , but in the station .
<user> Why not ? You told me that subway is a kind of train . If it had no restroom . what kind of train would that be ?
<assistant> Well , that is a question . You want to offer a suggestion ?
<user> Oh , yeah , but not today . I am busy with praying the subway may get there as fast as possible .
<assistant> I guess you'll never forget today .

<user> This broth is wonderful . What's in it ?

<assistant> You'll be OK . It's just a little bit ...

<assistant> Okay , sir , let me hit the delete button , and your reservation will be cancelled .
<user> That was nice and fast . Thanks .
<assistant> Not at all .

<user> I'm about to run out of business cards . I need some new ones .
<assistant> We can print as many as you like . Just tell me how many .
<user> Two thousand should get me through the year .
<assistant> Here's a form to get you started .
<user> My old card is perfect , so all I want you to do is copy it exactly .
<assistant> I think you'll be very pleased with how well we duplicate your old card .
<user> ... Here you go
<assistant> Thanks . Come back here next Wednesday to pick up your order , please .
<user> I'm sorry , but can you give me a three-day turnaround ?
<assistant> If you don't mind paying a little extra , it's absolutely no problem .

<user> Lisa , is there a milk section ?
<assistant> No , there's no such section . The dairy section is where you'll find milk and cheese .
<user> What's Condiments ?
<assistant> That's where you'll find things like salt and pepper .
<user> Oh , I see .
<assistant> Let's go to aisle 4 to pick up some pasta for tonight .
<user> Great ! Pasta for dinner .
<assistant> And let's get a loaf of bread at the bakery for breakfast .
<user> Maybe we should get a shopping cart .
<assistant> I'll put the shopping basket back .

<user> Did you lock the doors ?
<assistant> All except the back door . I left that open for Tim . He took the dog for a walk .
<user> Well , I'm going on to bed . I'm beat .
<assistant> Okay . I'm going to stay up a while . I've got to go over the household budget . We're a little overspent this month .
<user> Please tell Tim to close the door to the basement . I don't want the dog down there tonight .
<assistant> Okay . Good night . See you at breakfast .

<user> Well , I'm glad you're finally back . I was wondering what happened .
<assistant> I feel kind of stupid .
<user> Why ?
<assistant> We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet .
<user> You got lost . You're kidding !
<assistant> No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost .
<user> You could have called .
<assistant> I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were .
<user> You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ?
<assistant> Guess where we ended up .
<user> I don't know . Where ?
<assistant> When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield .
<user> Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ?
<assistant> I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .
<user> Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
<assistant> I know it is . I don't know how it happened .
<user> Hmm , maybe I do .
<assistant> What ?
<user> Maybe I have an idea how it happened .
<assistant> How ?
<user> You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road .
<assistant> Oh , that's what you think , huh ?

<user> Won't you have some of this ?
<assistant> Yes , thanks .
<user> It's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue .
<assistant> It's very good . How do you make it ?
<user> I use a special dressing and homemade catsup .
<assistant> This salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day .
<user> I'm glad you like it .
<assistant> You Americans usually have nutritious food .
<user> Oh , but Chinese food is so delicious . I wish I knew how to cook Chinese food . Do you follow recipes ?
<assistant> We use different spices but few people use recipes . They learn to cook by experience .
<user> I always use a recipe but my grandmother never did . She was a great cook . She would make clam chowder and cornbread every Sunday night .

<user> I like these shoes .
<assistant> Do you realize that all these shoes are half off ?
<user> Really ?
<assistant> Yes , but the offer only lasts this week .

<user> Do you have experience in advertising ?
<assistant> Yes , I used to have a part-time job in advertising company .
<user> What were you mean duties there ?
<assistant> I mostly did advertising planning .
<user> What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ?
<assistant> I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market .
<user> What was the most important thing you have learned at work ?
<assistant> The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact in success . If I want to make in marking in advertising history , I can ' t stop studying and creating .

<user> Dad , may I have a room of my own ?
<assistant> Oh , honey , I'm so sorry , we don't have enough space for you to have your own room .
<user> Dad , but I don't want to share a room with Peter . He snores every night .
<assistant> Honey , you can ask him to be quite . Otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ?
<user> Alright . Maybe it's the only way to do it .

<user> Come in and sit down , Jack . Now , what's the trouble ?
<assistant> I've got a terrible pain in my stomach , Doctor .
<user> I see . When did it start ?
<assistant> It started yesterday . I didn't eat any supper .
<user> Have you got a temperature ?
<assistant> I think so . I feel very hot .
<user> Let's see . Yes . You ' Ve got quite a high temperature .
<assistant> I've got an awful headache , too , and my throat hurts .
<user> Hm ... I think you ' Ve got the flu .
<assistant> Is it serious ?
<user> No , not at all , but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine .
<assistant> How often must I take it ?
<user> Three times a day after meals .
<assistant> Thank you , Doctor.Goodbye .

<user> Why don ' t you sit down and relax , darling ?
<assistant> I don ' t want to .
<user> Well , come and talk to me then .
<assistant> Certainly not .
<user> May I turn on the radio then ?
<assistant> Turn on the radio ? What for ?
<user> So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
<assistant> Listen to some music ? And who ' ll cook dinner ? Will you ?
<user> Ok , I will . But let ' s go to a disco after dinner .
<assistant> To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate pop .

<user> Good afternoon , ma'am . May I help you ?
<assistant> Yes . Can I deposit valuables here ?
<user> Of course , you can . Please put your articles in this bag and seal it .

<user> Good afternoon Miss , would you be interested in buying more life insurance ? You know , you can never get enough .
<assistant> I think my husband has some .
<user> Are you sure he ' s purchased enough insurance for both of you ? If something terrible happened with your husband , and he doesn ' t have sufficient insurance , my company does have a policy that could cover you and your husband if something happened to either of you .
<assistant> That ' s true . If something happened to my husband , I might lose everything . Both of us have to work to keep our home , car , and our children ' s education . I can ' t afford that by myself .
<user> Could we sit and look at the policy I mentioned and see if that ' s something suitable for you and your husband ?
<assistant> Certainly .

<user> The buildings are really magnificent .
<assistant> Yes , millions of travelers come here every year for the view of the buildings .
<user> The journey is worth while . Where are we going after this ?
<assistant> We will visit the Statue of Liberty as scheduled .

<user> Excuse me .
<assistant> Yes ?
<user> Do you have any information about the city sights ?
<assistant> Sure . There ' s a lot here in this pamphlet .
<user> Thank you . And what ' s the best way to get downtown ?
<assistant> Take the subway . It ' s  1.50 per ride . You can buy a petrol card at the station .
<user> You ' Ve been very helpful .
<assistant> My pleasure .

<user> I want to open a saving account , sir.What ' s the proper procedure ?
<assistant> First , you fill out the application form and then we'll issue you a passbook .
<user> Is there any minimum for the first deposit ?
<assistant> No , Even a dollar is all right.Here ' s your passbook , sir ; just sign your name on it .
<user> What is the annual interest rate ?
<assistant> It varies from time to time.At present it is 6  .
<user> By the way , can I open a checking account too ?
<assistant> By all means.But you have to deposit enough money before you can write out your checks .

<user> You look depressed . What's on your mind ?
<assistant> Well , I had a blood test last week . The doctor said that I have high blood pressure and my blood is thick and sticky . I'm very worried .
<user> Take it easy . When we last talked , you promised there would be more exercises in your life . But now you are putting on some weight .
<assistant> I have to admit it's easier said than done .
<user> Well , I think it's time for you to change your eating habits and develop a healthy lifestyle . Regular exercise will improve your health .
<assistant> But you know I'm just not into exercises . And I wouldn't have time for exercises , either .
<user> You can do some jogging . It's easy and it doesn't take much time .
<assistant> Actually , my doctor said the same thing .

<user> Excuse me , sir , but you have to put your bags here before entering the market .
<assistant> Oh . I am sorry . I was busy looking for some whisky.Can you tell me the exactly place where I can find any ?
<user> Yes , it's on the third floor .

<user> Here ' s my passport . I'm a visiting scholar .
<assistant> Do you have anything to declare ?
<user> No , these are all my personal effects .
<assistant> What's in the bag ? Would you mind opening the bag ?
<user> Not at all . I don't know what's dutiable . Do I have to pay duty on things for my own use ?
<assistant> NO . You don't have to pay duty on personal belongings .
<user> Thank you .

<user> Do you work well under pressure ?
<assistant> Working under pressure is exciting and challenging . I don ' t mind working under pressure . I work well under that circumstance . People can , I can .
<user> Do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
<assistant> No , nothing in particular .
<user> How soon can you begin working for us ?
<assistant> I need about two to three weeks for necessary formalities . I will quit then transfer to your company .

<user> What do you want ?
<assistant> I think I have a piece of apple pie .
<user> Do you want something to drink ?
<assistant> Coffee would be fine .
<user> OK . Sit down and I'll get it .

<user> Our new production control program's going live on Monday . The old and the new programs will operate in tandem for four to six weeks . That should give us time to iron out any little problems .
<assistant> Hope it all goes well . We're very busy at the moment and certainly don't want any problems at this time of year .
<user> Yes , I realise that . We've spent a long time planning and preparing for the change-over . I'm confident we won't have any major problems .

<user> Who broke my chair ?
<assistant> It wasn't me .

<user> Come in , please .
<assistant> Good morning , sir !
<user> Good morning , please make yourself comfortable .

<user> Can you leave me your phone number ?
<assistant> Gladly , 8962105 2 .

<user> Good morning . May I help you ?
<assistant> Yes . I'm looking for an apartment , I'd like two bedrooms .
<user> All right . Have a seat , please . Let me ask you a few questions . First of all , may I have your name , please ?
<assistant> My name's Donald Eakins .
<user> How do you spell your last name , Mr.Eakins .
<assistant> It's E-A-K-I-N-S .
<user> E-A-K-I-N-S.First name , Donald . And what's your present address , Mr.Eakins ?
<assistant> It's 1446 Pine Street .
<user> 1446 Pine . That's in San Francisco , isn't it ?
<assistant> Yes , it is .

<user> Did you check before you left the shop ?
<assistant> Yes , I did . But when I got home , my son put it on and we found the hole .
<user> Really ? Let me have a look at it . Mm . OK . Let me change it for another one .
<assistant> Thank you very much .

<user> I hate to do this , but I've got to cancel a reservation I made earlier this week .
<assistant> All I need is your name , phone , and reservation date .
<user> My name is Rudy Randolph . I'm at 818-555-1234 . The reservation was for April 9 .
<assistant> Randolph , Rudy . Let me hit one button , sir , and now your reservation is cancelled .
<user> Okay , thank you . I'll make another reservation as soon as I can .
<assistant> It's been my pleasure to help you .

<user> Did you go and buy your bus pass ?
<assistant> No , I didn't .
<user> When are you going to go get it ?
<assistant> I'm not sure where they sell bus passes at .
<user> Why didn't you just ask me ?
<assistant> Where should I go ?
<user> You can get one from student services .
<assistant> I had no clue that I could get it there .
<user> I already knew that .
<assistant> Thanks for letting me know .
<user> You're welcome .
<assistant> I'm going to go and get it right now .

<user> Tomorrow is my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ?
<assistant> Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ' s dress code .
<user> Indeed , I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview . Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . It seems that their dress code is not that formal . Probably , I should put on car key and simple shirt .
<assistant> Whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean .

<user> Excuse me . Will you please keep an eye on my suitcase ? I just want to make a phone call .
<assistant> Certainly , but will it take long ?
<user> No , I'll be right back .
<assistant> OK . I'll look after it then .

<user> Mike's Mechanics . Can I help you ?
<assistant> Yes , how do I get to your shop from Chilin ?
<user> Go straight up Zhongshan Road and you will see our sign on your right , after you pass the museum .
<assistant> Thank you very much .

<user> Don't take too much off . I'm trying to grow my hair longer .
<assistant> How about two inches ?
<user> That sounds perfect . Do you think I can get some highlights today , too ? I've always wanted red .
<assistant> I think that will over-process your hair , you should wait at least two weeks .
<user> All right . I'll just have the cut and perm today .
<assistant> Great . My assistant will wash your hair , and then I'll be back to help you .
<user> OK .

<user> Oh , damn . There ' s another traffic jam on the highway .
<assistant> How can there be a traffic jam on a 16 - lane highway every day ?
<user> There are just too many people , and too many cars .
<assistant> I wonder if there was an accident .
<user> No , they just said it too many people were trying to get off at the Capitol exits .
<assistant> Well , let ' s put on some music . We ' re going to be stuck in this for a while .
<user> All right , what do you want to listen to ?
<assistant> How about some Beatles ?
<user> Yeah , all right .

<user> Excuse me . Mr . Emory ?
<assistant> Yes , Ms . Rodriguez ? How can I help you ?
<user> I wanted to see if I could arrange a meeting with you to discuss recruitment .
<assistant> Absolutely . I ' Ve been wanting to meet with you about that . Let me just get my book .

<user> Who ate the cookies that were sitting here ?
<assistant> I did , Mom .
<user> Shame on you . I was saving them for your brother .

<user> Hello . May I speak to Brian , please ?
<assistant> Sorry , you have the wrong number . There ' s no Brian here .
<user> Is this 777-9345 ?
<assistant> No , it ' s 777-9344 ?
<user> Oh , I ' m so sorry .
<assistant> That ' s OK .

<user> Put all baggage on the conveyor belt . Walk through the detector age one at a time , please .
<assistant> Excuse me , ma'ma . Could you walk back through the doorway again , please ?
<user> What for ?
<assistant> Airport security . Could you empty your pockets over here , please ?
<user> Really ? I'm in a hurry . All right .
<assistant> Ah , a set of keys .
<user> I'm embarrassed ! I forgot completely about them . I'm terribly sorry .
<assistant> That's all right . Enjoy your flight .
<user> Thank you .

<user> What's the matter with you , Paul ?
<assistant> I'm not feeling well . I think I'm having a cold .
<user> Looks like it.You need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest .
<assistant> Yeah , I will .

<user> Come on . All of us are waiting for you .
<assistant> Oh , sorry . Cross my fingers .

<user> Come on , Mary . We have to do the laundry .
<assistant> Where are we going ?
<user> Down to the basement .
<assistant> Do you have a washer down there ?
<user> Yes . We have a dryer , too .
<assistant> That's so convenient . Where are the dirty clothes ?
<user> They are in the basement already .
<assistant> But I didn't see you carry them down .
<user> Don't you know that we have a laundry chute in the house ?

<user> Hi , John .
<assistant> Oh , hi , Mary , come on in . Any problem ?
<user> Oh , no problem .
<assistant> Great . I forgot to ask you , though . How long did you want the place ?
<user> Six months .
<assistant> Oh , well , that might be a problem . I usually only sign one year leases .
<user> Well , one year would be fine , too . I ' m not planning on leaving the area anytime soon .
<assistant> Well , if it ' s not a problem . Then here you go .
<user> Just let me look at it quickly .
<assistant> Of course .
<user> Looks like a standard lease .
<assistant> Yeah , and don ' t worry about the security deposit . If everything ' s all right when you move out , you ' ll get it back .
<user> O . K . Great . Just sign and date it here ?
<assistant> Yes . Thanks . You can move your stuff in tomorrow .
<user> Wonderful .

<user> Excuse me , could you tell me the bookshop ' s address ?
<assistant> Yes , the bookshop is just around the corner.Turn left and you ' ll see the bookshop .
<user> Thank you very much.By the way , is the hospital beside the bookshop .
<assistant> Right , if you see the bookshop , you can see the hospital .
<user> Thank you for your help .
<assistant> Not at all .

<user> Hello ! Is this Mr . Chang ?
<assistant> Yes . Who is speaking ?
<user> This is Kelly speaking . I am calling from London . How are you , Mr . Chang ?
<assistant> Oh , Kelly , I couldn't recognize your voice . Well , I'm fine .
<user> Mr . Chang , I just want to tell you that we are leaving London for Beijing by flight CP 645 on Saturday morning . Could you meet us at the airport , please ?
<assistant> Excuse me , I couldn't quite hear you . This line is crossed . Can you speak louder , please ?
<user> I will say it again ... Do you hear me now ?
<assistant> Much better . I will definitely go to the airport to meet you .
<user> Thank you very much . Goodbye .
<assistant> Goodbye .

<user> Hello , Mr . Hammer . Jack Ross here . I'm calling to confirm our appointment on Monday at ten o'clock in your office .
<assistant> Yes . Everything's all set .
<user> I'd like to bring Mr . Huang and Ms . Sun with me .
<assistant> We're supposed to be meeting alone .
<user> I know , but I think they may add something valuable to the discussion .
<assistant> Fine . But no one else , OK ?
<user> Yes , Mr . Hammer .

<user> How beautiful the flower is !
<assistant> Really , it's so beautiful .
<user> You like it . Well , I'll gather in for you .
<assistant> You mustn't pick it in this place .
<user> Where it is ?
<assistant> It's a private garden .

<user> You look fresh recently . And .. what's your weight now ?
<assistant> 110 pounds .
<user> Really ? Congratulations ! That's really something beyond my imagination . How did you make it ? Did you keep on a diet ?
<assistant> No , you know I can't bear eating less .
<user> Then do the slim pills take effect on you ?
<assistant> I've quit it already . I go to aerobics class everyday instead .
<user> How's it going on ?
<assistant> You see . I've lost my weight in spite of my good appetite .
<user> I'd better exercise my body too . My limbs are rusty now .
<assistant> I don't think so . You look full of energy every day . Time has stood still with you .
<user> Thank you .

<user> Ahhs ! I'm beat !
<assistant> What happened to you ? You look like you got hit by a tornado !
<user> I just got back from fighting the crowds .
<assistant> You mean at the mall ? Was there a sale ?
<user> Yeah . For five minutes , everything was half off . It was total chaos ...
<assistant> Cool !
<user> Grabbing , pushing and shoving ...

<user> Thank god you are open ! I have an emergency !
<assistant> Hello , Mr . Henderson what can I do for you ?
<user> I need this dress and this suit dry cleaned ASAP !
<assistant> OK , I can have it ready by the end of the week .
<user> No , you don ' t understand , I need this tomorrow morning ! I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ' s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! She ' s gonna kill me !
<assistant> OK , I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon , but this suit is also very stained . I can ' t guarantee we can remove it completely .
<user> Fine ! Can you also iron and starch this shirt ?
<assistant> Certainly .
<user> Great ! This is our secret ! If you see my wife , say nothing to her about this !

<user> How often does the bus run ?
<assistant> Every five minutes .
<user> Oh , here comes a bus !
<assistant> It comes on the dot .

<user> My warmest congratulations on your promotion !
<assistant> Thanks . It ' s nothing special actually .
<user> Don ' t say that . It owes to your efforts and team spirit .
<assistant> Oh , it was nothing . Anyone could have done it . I still have a lot to learn yet .
<user> You are very modest . Best luck in your new position .
<assistant> Thank you . I won ' t let this promotion change me .

<user> Yes , emergency . There is a huge fire here .
<assistant> Calm down , sir . What's your name and where are you now ?
<user> My name is Jerry and we are on the intersection of West Road and East Road .
<assistant> Sir , leave the house if the fire draws any closer to your house . Our men will be over in 5 minutes .

<user> Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ?
<assistant> Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it .
<user> Totally agree . What is your solution ?
<assistant> Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy .
<user> You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
<assistant> It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
<user> But I don ' t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .
<assistant> I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .

<user> Excuse me , is this the parcel counter ?
<assistant> Yes , what can I do for you ?

<assistant> Yeah . And would you like to mail it by air ?
<user> No , I'd rather send it by sea .
<assistant> Thirteen yuan , please . Here is the receipt and change .
<user> Thank you .
<assistant> You are welcome .

<user> But Ernie , we're still missing something . We need someone to play the music !
<assistant> Oh right ... you know , my friend Eric is a DJ . Maybe he would like to play with us .
<user> Hmm ... does he have a good ear for hip hop music ?
<assistant> Well , I don't know , but we can find out . We can talk to him and ask if he wants to join our group .

<user> Excuse me , is there any room available ? I want a single one .
<assistant> Yes . When do you want it ?
<user> Next Today . By the way , is there a closed circuit TV ?
<assistant> Yes , sir .
<user> What about laundry ?
<assistant> Sorry , sir . You have to pay by yourself .

<user> What time does the museum close ? Any idea ?
<assistant> I'm not sure , but I think It's open until 4 o'clock .
<user> What time is it now ?
<assistant> It's a quarter past three .

<user> I would like to buy some local handcrafts as gifts to my friends and relatives .
<assistant> There are many stores selling handcrafts in Paris . Our store is wellknown for vase , table wear and jewelry boxes . You can take your time and choose whatever you like .
<user> Well , the tapestry is delicate and beautiful .
<assistant> You have made an excellent choice , it is our newcomer . The tapestry is on hot sell with the design and quality . The design on it is traditional Paris architecture .
<user> How much is it ?
<assistant> 100 frances .
<user> Mmm , it is reasonable . Look at this set of table wear , it is so beautiful !
<assistant> We have a piece of table clothing to go with it . It is a brocade one with pretty stars .
<user> This silver vase is a good ornament for the living room .
<assistant> You are right .
<user> I will take the tapestry , the set of table wear and the vase .
<assistant> OK . Do you like these candles ? They are on sale now .
<user> All right . I will take one .

<user> It's so boring .
<assistant> Don't you like it ?
<user> I don't . Is there anything worth watching on the other channel ?
<assistant> I think it's a basketball match on channel 5 .
<user> Do you mind if we switch over ?
<assistant> Well , I'd rather see a movie .
<user> What's the movie ?
<assistant> ' Star war ' .
<user> It must be interesting .
<assistant> Yes , you're right .

<user> Where can I get my baggage ?
<assistant> Are you from a domestic flight or an international one ?
<user> An international one from Seattle .
<assistant> In that case , you should go to the baggage hall over there .
<user> Oh yes , I see the sign , thank you .

<user> Man ! That car almost hit me !
<assistant> Yeah , that was close .

<user> Excuse me .
<assistant> Yes ?
<user> Could you tell me where the copy room is ?
<assistant> Sure . You just walk down this hallway . The copy room is the second room on the right .

<user> Doctor , save my baby , please
<assistant> What symptoms does he have ?
<user> He has had a fever for one day . Just now at home , he had febrile convulsions with teeth and fists clenched and eyes turned up . We were at a loss what to do . We called an ambulance and brought the baby here .
<assistant> How long did the convulsion last ?
<user> About 3 minutes .
<assistant> Does he have any other complaints ?
<user> Three days ago , he began to cough , sneeze and have a running nose . Yesterday , he began to have a fever .
<assistant> Have you taken his temperature ?
<user> It was 38  C this morning and it was 39  C just now .
<assistant> Let me examine him to see if there is any rash . No rash .
<user> Is it serious ? Is it meningitis ?
<assistant> No , it is not meningitis . Just a high fever and convulsions , which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection .
<user> Does he have to be admitted to hospital ?
<assistant> No . No need for admission . I'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first . Then I will give you a prescription . The pink tablets are used for his fever . When his temperature is over 38  C , give him one tablet . The other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions . The white liquid is for the cold . Give the baby plenty of water to drink .
<user> Thank you very much , doctor .

<user> Jack ! Do you want to see a picture of my new puppy ?
<assistant> Sure . I thought people only showed off pictures of their new babies , not new pets !
<user> Well , this is my new baby . He ' s just as much trouble . That ' s for sure ! But , he ' s a lot of fun !
<assistant> I see what you mean . He ' s really cute . How old is he ?

<user> Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me ! I ' Ve always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me ! Let ' s get started !
<assistant> Ok , let ' s start opening some presents !
<user> Oh look ! What a great little bib for the baby ! This will definitely come in handy ! Oh wow , you also got me a stroller ! That ' s so great ! Thank you !
<assistant> This next one is from Betty .
<user> A highchair and car seat ! Wow Betty , thank you so much ! I really appreciate it !
<assistant> One more from Carla .
<user> A playpen and crib ! Thanks Carla ! This is just what I needed !
<assistant> OK , that ' s all of them . No more gifts . Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ?
<user> Umm . I think my water just broke ! Get me to a hospital !

<user> Wow , this is amazing . I'm glad we've come here . So cool .
<assistant> I always love skiing . You know , it's a cool game for cool people . Stay with me and you will be cool , too .
<user> Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look .
<assistant> Sure . It's probably the skiing show . Adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
<user> See that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .
<assistant> Hey , don't be so pathetic . It's a maximal sports show . What else can they do to attract more visitors ? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
<user> You are right . But what if the avalanche happened ?
<assistant> They are all very experienced and great skiers . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
<user> Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow in here ?
<assistant> Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ?
<user> Hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist .
<assistant> Sorry . Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .
<user> Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
<assistant> It's possible . But the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
<user> It's a good thing . OK , let's go skiing .
<assistant> Here we go .

<assistant> Once the US economy is in trouble due to the terrorist attack , the impact could be quickly felt in the rest of the world .

<user> Will it hurt much ?

<assistant> Isn't that a bit excessive ?
<user> I'm sorry , sir . It's our policy .
<assistant> OK . Here is the money .
<user> Thank you . Welcome to our hotel again .

<user> Can I help you , sir ?
<assistant> Yes , I'd like to look at some suits .
<user> Oh , this way please . What size do you wear ?
<assistant> Size 41 . I want something in dark flannel .
<user> How about this one ?
<assistant> It feels all right . But if it were a darker color , I'd like it better . This seems too light for winter . Do you think you could get me one ?
<user> All right . I'll show you something darker . Do you like this one ?
<assistant> It looks good . But can I try it on ?
<user> Of course . Let me help you .
<assistant> Thanks . It's comfortable . Well , how much is it , please ?
<user>  280 .
<assistant> Ok . I'll take it . Here's the money .

<user> Mike , you're seventeen years old , right ?
<assistant> Yeah , Why ?
<user> You look quite mature beside your cousin who is eighteen .
<assistant> You can bet on that .

<user> Come in and sit down .
<assistant> Thanks , Mr . Liang .
<user> Among all the assistants , I think you're on top of it . Based on the annual evaluation , the board of directors decided to give you a bonus .
<assistant> Really ? I am too happy .
<user> I've been reviewing your work over the past few months . Thanks to your excellent work , we benefit much from your project . And you should get the perfect attendance award too .
<assistant> Thanks for your trust . Owing to my colleagues ' help , I've successfully completed my task .
<user> You are very modest and diligent . The distribution of bonus derived from the performance evaluation . You deserve it .
<assistant> Thank you very much . I will redouble my efforts in the future .

<user> Donna ! How are you ? It's good to hear your voice .
<assistant> Thank you . Jack , it's always a pleasure doing business with you .
<user> So how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave ?
<assistant> Great ! And , how are things in your neck of the woods ?
<user> Things are so great here . I almost smiled myself to death last week . One of my coworkers had to give me CPR .
<assistant> Oh.Jack , I have missed your sense of humor.Ha ha ha ! Nobody else sees things quite like you do.It ' s your gift .
<user> Or a curse .
<assistant> Nope , it's a gift.Anyway , we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time .
<user> That , my dear , was classic sales technique delivered by a professional .
<assistant> Are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit ?
<user> Heck no , we doubled the price , but because it's you , I'll let you have'em at 50 off .
<assistant> You silver-tongued devil . Can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no ?
<user> I could , but where's the fun in that ?

<user> Hi . I ' m here for flight 514 returning to Beijing but the board shows there is a delay.How long of a delay is expected ?
<assistant> So far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case .
<user> Do you think it ' s safe to leave to get a quick bite ?
<assistant> I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ?
<user> What seems to be the problem ?
<assistant> It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . It happens all the time . No need to worry .
<user> Umm ... You know ... Actually I was thinking of trying another airline . No need to hold my seat .

<user> I need to go to the ATM .
<assistant> So , why don ' t you ?
<user> I have no idea how to use the ATM .
<assistant> What do you mean ?
<user> This will be my first time using an ATM .
<assistant> I can help you with that .
<user> Explain to me how to use it .
<assistant> Just put your card into the machine .
<user> Now what do I do ?
<assistant> Then you need to type in your PIN .
<user> Now what ?
<assistant> Just click on one of the choices they give you , and that ' s it .

<user> Would you like something to drink ?
<assistant> Yes please . Do you have any teas ?
<user> Of course we have lots of teas ?
<assistant> What do you recommend ?
<user> What about a green tea or perhaps a jasmine tea ?
<assistant> What ' s this one ?
<user> That ' s Oolong tea  it ' s a Cantonese tea .
<assistant> Ok , I ' ll try that .

<user> May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ?
<assistant> Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing !
<user> Why are they all in glass boxes ?
<assistant> For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air .
<user> So there isn't air in the glass boxes ?
<assistant> No , there isn't . They are all vacuumed .
<user> I wonder how old these things are , thousands of years ?
<assistant> Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time .
<user> Hey , look at the three-leg cup . I've seen it on TV .
<assistant> The bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless !
<user> Yeah , it has no value at all . Who will use this cup today ?
<assistant> Danny , priceless means so valuable that you can't put a price on it .
<user> Oh , it does ?

<user> I am so worried about this English contest . I have butterflies in my stomach now !
<assistant> I have confidence in you . Believe in yourself .

<user> What would you like on your pizzas ?
<assistant> We want one vegetarian supreme and one double pepperoni .
<user> Would you like anything to drink with that ? For  1.50 , you can get a two-liter bottle of Coke .
<assistant> No , thanks .
<user> All right . That'll be  12.50 . Your pizzas will be there in 30 minutes .
<assistant> Thanks .

<user> We are redecorating and I'm going to add some things .
<assistant> Well , I'll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office .
<user> Shall we meet at 1:15 this Thursday ? We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .
<assistant> Fine , I'll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday .

<user> Can you tell me the way to library ?
<assistant> Sure , turn left at the next crossing .
<user> Is it on Xinhua street ?
<assistant> Yes . You can't miss it .

<user> Comfort Inn , may I help you ?
<assistant> I ' m looking for a hotel near the convention center .
<user> You ' re in luck ! We ' re just a two-minute drive from there . Would you like to make a reservation ?
<assistant> Not just yet . I have one or two questions . How much for a single ?
<user> During the peak season , a single room goes for 50 dollars on a night . But we ' Ve got a Single Super Saver Special going on right now  only  30 a night . And we ' Ve also extended our checkout time 00 in
<assistant> That ' s a good deal . Since this is a working trip , I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients .
<user> Yes , we have five meeting rooms , of various sizes . We can accommodate large meetings and small , informal gatherings as well . Of course , if you have many small meeting , you might consider checking
<assistant> That sounds great . Do you accept checks ?
<user> I ' m sorry , sir , we don ' t . But we do accept all major credit cards .

<user> I am sorry to trouble you , but there's a lot of noise in the next room .
<assistant> Oh , is there ? Which room is it ?
<user> It's . I think , neighbours on the right .
<assistant> You mean the room thirteen-thirteen ?
<user> I'm not sure , but I think so . I'm very exhausted , but I can't sleep .
<assistant> All right , ma'am . I'll check and tell them to be quiet .
<user> If next room is still noisy , could you give me a different room , please ?

<user> Have you ever been to Xi ' an ?
<assistant> Yes , I ' Ve been there several times on business trips . But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city .
<user> I ' Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ' t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place .
<assistant> I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening .
<user> Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ?
<assistant> Well , the airport is quite far from the downtown area , but it is still more convenient than taking the train .

<user> A ticket to London , please .
<assistant> A cheap day return ticket ?
<user> Yes , including London Tube .
<assistant> That'll be twelve pounds .

<user> Doctor , what is the best way to stay healthy ?
<assistant> Having a good diet is probably the most important thing .
<user> It is very confusing to know what to eat .
<assistant> You need plenty of fruits and vegetables , small amounts of protein , and whole grains .
<user> Are there certain things that I should avoid ?
<assistant> You shouldn ' t consume too much sugar or caffeine . Also , watch your intake of fatty food .
<user> After watching my diet , what else should I do ?
<assistant> You need to stop smoking , and make sure that you get 30 minutes of exercise every day .
<user> Can I have a glass of wine now and then ?
<assistant> As long as you don ' t overdo it , a glass of wine a day should be OK .

<user> Darling , I am back . What are you doing ?
<assistant> I am washing clothes . Are you hungry now ? Wait for a moment , I'll cook dinner for you . ( Steven bends his brows )
<user> B , should we get a maid ?
<assistant> I can do all the housework . We don't need a maid .
<user> You have worked very hard in the office . If we can get someone to help you , you can have more rest .
<assistant> We really don't need to .
<user> You are a good wife , Julia . But you must take care of yourself .
<assistant> Give me some time to think about it .

<user> Can I reserve a room from the 13th to the 18th ?
<assistant> Certainly . How do you like your room ?
<user> I'd like a suite . What's the rate ?
<assistant>  40 per night .

<user> Is there anything I can do for you ?
<assistant> Excuse me , can I change my order ? I am afraid I don't have so much time to enjoy my dinner .
<user> I am sorry , sir . Your fish will be ready in five minutes so you can't change it .
<assistant> That's all right .

<user> Have you graduated now ?
<assistant> Yes . I graduated this past June .
<user> Which university did you graduate from ?
<assistant> Guangzhou University .
<user> What degree did you receive ?

<user> What courses did you take in college ?
<assistant> My major courses were Microeconomics , Macroeconomics , International Trade , International Finance , World Economy , Psychology and Business English

<assistant> I can also speak a little Japanese .
<user> I am very satisfied with your answers .
<assistant> Thank you very much .

<user> Once you arrive at the American airport , please call me .
<assistant> OK , don ' t worry about it . I will .
<user> Take care of yourself .

<user> Sorry , Mary , I can't make it in time for dinner .
<assistant> Okay , Bob , when will I see you ?
<user> Maybe I will be around later .
<assistant> Okay , I'll see you later .

<user> I am sorry , sir . I have broken the reading lamp in my room .
<assistant> Well , sir . May I have your room number ?
<user> 503 . I would like to pay for it .
<assistant> Please fill out the form first .
<user> OK , can you bring me a new one ?
<assistant> Of course .

<user> Excuse me . I need to refill this prescription .
<assistant> It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
<user> Yes , I need to refill it today .
<assistant> Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice .
<user> I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not .
<assistant> Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
<user> Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ?
<assistant> I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out .
<user> But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription .
<assistant> Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never .
<user> But I have a prescription . I just need more of it .
<assistant> A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
<user> Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
<assistant> Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry .
<user> This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it .
<assistant> Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too .

<user> What are you doing ?
<assistant> I ' m trying to put the vase on the shelf .
<user> Let regive you a hand .
<assistant> No , thank you . I can manage it , I think .

<user> There are so many record players here . That is hard to choose .
<assistant> Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
<user> I'd rather get one with separated speakers.They give a clear sound .
<assistant> Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
<user> That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony .
<assistant> Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration .

<user> Ahhchooo !
<assistant> You've been sneezing a lot lately . Are you sick or something ?
<user> No . Every spring time around April , I'm stricken with allergies .
<assistant> I never have seasonal allergies .
<user> Consider yourself lucky .
<assistant> What are all the symptoms ?
<user> Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water .
<assistant> That doesn't sound good .
<user> No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ?
<assistant> Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family .
<user> Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol .
<assistant> I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body .
<user> That's pretty bad .
<assistant> But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah .

<user> Let's have a look at the map first .
<assistant> All right . Wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here .
<user> Let's buy some tickets .
<assistant> The train is coming . There are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train
<user> Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ?
<assistant> No , but it will be soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them .

<user> What do you do ?
<assistant> I'm an apprentice with a local engineering firm . My training lasts for two years . Two days a week I study Engineering at a local college . If I pass all my exams , I hope the company will take me on as an engineer .

<user> I want to keep a pet , but I don't know which one to buy ?
<assistant> Dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day .
<user> Having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then .
<assistant> What about cats ? They are more independent .
<user> Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat .
<assistant> How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ?
<user> Yeah , are they easy to look after ?
<assistant> Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything .

<user> Can I be of any service to you ?
<assistant> I've been told that Chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship . We'd like to take some home . What would you recommend ?
<user> There are over a thousands kinds of articles in our shop.For example , there is tricolored pottery originating in the Tang Dynasty , embroidery , batik , jade carving , just to name a few.Do you have anything in mind ?
<assistant> No , not really.But I think it should be something distinctively Chinese . And easy to carry .
<user> I would suggest you buy paper-cuts , embroidery and batik.They are very easy to carry .
<assistant> So , we'd like to see some embroidery .

<user> Hey , Mary . We're back . Have you eaten yet ?
<assistant> I had some bread for breakfast .
<user> Let's go out for brunch .
<assistant> Brunch ?
<user> It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . On Sundays , many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch . Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also .
<assistant> Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch .

<user> Hi , my name is Sovia.What ' s your name ?
<assistant> My name is Jeff .
<user> What do you do ?
<assistant> I ' m a podiatrist . What about you ?
<user> I ' m a nurse.What do you do in your free time ?
<assistant> I like to play piano , go bowling and chat with my friends.And you ?
<user> I like to hang out with my friends , play games and go swimming .
<assistant> Would you like to go out some time ?
<user> Sure , that ' d be great.Where would you like to go ?
<assistant> Anywhere with you .
<user> Aren ' t you sweet .

<user> Oh , I'm starving . I'd like to try some real Chinese cuisine . What would you recommend , waiter ?
<assistant> Well , it depends . You see , there are eight famous Chinese for instance , the Sichuan cuisine , and the Hunan cuisine .
<user> They are both spicy hot , I've heard .
<assistant> That's right . If you like hot dishes , you could try some .
<user> They might be too hot for me .
<assistant> Then there's the Cantonese cuisine and the Kiangsu cuisine . Most southerners like them .
<user> What about any special Beijing dishes ?
<assistant> There's the Beijing roast duck .
<user> Oh , yes . I've heard a lot about it . I'd like very much to try it . Where can I find it ?
<assistant> You can find it in most restaurants , but the best place is certainly Quanjude Restaurant .
<user> Is it near here ?
<assistant> Not too near but not too far either . A taxi will take you there in 15 minutes , If the traffic is not too bad , I mean .
<user> Well , thank you for your information . But what is the name of that restaurant again ?
<assistant> Let me write it down on this slip of paper for you . You can show it to the taxi-driver .
<user> That's very kind of you . Thanks a lot .

<user> hi , Isaiah . How are you ?
<assistant> I ' m well . And you ?
<user> fine . How ' s your job going ?
<assistant> I don ' t know if I told you or not , but I decided to start my own business .
<user> really ? That ' s fantastic . What kind of business is it ?
<assistant> I ' Ve started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from Goldman Sachs .
<user> how ' s it going ?
<assistant> it started off a bit slow , but now , business is really booming !
<user> that ' s such great news . I ' m really happy for you ! Where is your office located ?
<assistant> our headoffice is here in Beijing , but we ' re planning on opening up two more offices soon .
<user> where will those be located ?
<assistant> if all goes well , we ' ll open one up in Hong Kong in April and another one in Singapore in October .
<user> when will you find out ?
<assistant> we ' re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow .
<user> well , good luck . I hope it all goes well for you tomorrow !
<assistant> thanks !

<user> Ant Shirley , it's being years since we last met . How were you doing in the passing years ?
<assistant> Pretty well . What about you ?
<user> Fine . Where are the other guys ?
<assistant> It's a bit disappointing that they are all out for a movie .
<user> Bad timing . I want to see them so much . How are they ?
<assistant> Not bad . I heard you are going to graduate this coming summer , right ?
<user> Yes , that's why I'm here . I'm thinking about buying a second-hand apartment .
<assistant> Did you go to a real estate agent ?
<user> No , that will be too expensive .
<assistant> That's true . By the way , what kind of apartment are you looking for ?
<user> My first job's salary will be a bit low . So the cheaper the better . Just one I can afford .
<assistant> Sure . I'll try my best to find a satisfying one for you .
<user> I'll appreciate it so much .

<user> Good afternoon .
<assistant> My goodness ! It ' s the afternoon ? Doesn ' t the time fly ! Do come in and sit down .
<user> Thank you .
<assistant> What ' s the time ? My watch has stopped .
<user> It ' s half past twelve .
<assistant> When do you have lunch ?
<user> From one to two .
<assistant> What do you normally eat ?
<user> We usually go to the cafeteria .
<assistant> Oh , it ' s time to have lunch now .
<user> let ' s go together .

<user> Merry Christmas , Bill .
<assistant> Merry Christmas , Jina .
<user> What are you doing there on the computer ?
<assistant> Come have a look , I received many beautiful e-cards . They are from my friends , all over the world . Christmas wishes for all my friends .
<user> That's pretty interesting . Did you get one from Haven ? The reason I ask is that I am looking for her number .
<assistant> Sorry , I don't have it . But I do have her Email . You want me to sent it to you ?
<user> Yeah , that would be great . Thanks .
<assistant> No worries . I just for her card . And you can get her from Email . I would really like to talk to her again . I kind of miss her a little this days .
<user> Thanks million .
<assistant> My pleasure .

<user> There are so many eating utensils on the table . Which ones do I use first ?
<assistant> Use them from the outside in .
<user> I see . A set for appetizers and another for the main course .
<assistant> Right . We do the same thing at home . Don't you remember ?
<user> Oh yeah . The big napkin goes on my lap .
<assistant> Let's look at our menus .
<user> Cindy , help me order because I'm still not very familiar with American cooking .
<assistant> Well , we order appetizers first and then entrees .

<user> It was nice talking to you .
<assistant> Why are you trying to rush me off the phone ?
<user> I really have to go .
<assistant> Why ? I still wanted to talk to you .
<user> I have things to do .
<assistant> Like what ?
<user> Don't be nosey .
<assistant> I'm not . I just want to know .
<user> Well , it's really none of your business .
<assistant> That's harsh .
<user> I'm sorry , but I have to go .
<assistant> Fine .

<user> Mom , will you have time to help me with my homework today ?
<assistant> Sorry , I won't . I'll be working against the clock to finish my presentation .

<user> Well , Peter , you have to do better than that next time , won ' t you ?
<assistant> Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ?
<user> Of course , you have . You must try harder this time .
<assistant> And must I go back to school ?
<user> No , you needn ' t do that . You ' d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes .
<assistant> But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ' m nearly 17 .
<user> You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ' t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study .
<assistant> What else I ' Ve got to do ? Join the army ?
<user> Who knows ! That might come to later .

<user> How do you do ?
<assistant> How do you do ?
<user> My name is Wang Liang , I ' m from Beijing . Where do you come from ?
<assistant> I come from the city of Tangshan in Hebes Province .
<user> You're from Tangshan ? I can't believe my ears . I was also born in Tangshan , but I was brought up in Beijing .
<assistant> Really ? It's nice to meet you . How long have you been with this company ?
<user> Just over 4 years now . Since this is your first day here , I'm sure you don't really know too much yet . Let me show you around , so you can introduce yourself to everyone .
<assistant> Oh , Thank you very much !

<user> Hello , Parker . How's everything ?
<assistant> Can't complain . And you ?
<user> Business is booming . I understand you want to meet up with me next week . How's your schedule look ?
<assistant> Let me see . I can come out and see you first thing Wednesday .
<user> Great .

<user> I like to open up a savings account please .
<assistant> O . K . We offer a few different kinds .
<user> I want the one with the highest interest rate .
<assistant> That would be our Saver's Plus account .
<user> 4.5  , that's good . How much money do I have to keep in it to get that rate ?
<assistant> You have to maintain a balance of  10,000 in the account or the rate drops to 3  .
<user> All right . I ' ll open one of those .
<assistant> Just fill out these forms , and I ' ll be with you in one second .
<user> Thanks .

<user> Hi , where can I find a cheap cashmere sweater ?
<assistant> How about an outlet ?
<user> Great idea !
<assistant> Outlets give good deals .
<user> Thank you so much .
<assistant> You're welcome .

<user> I have difficulty with this form . Will you please explain it to me ?
<assistant> Actually there is a sample over there . But if you still have a problem , let me know .
<user> Oh , that's great . Thank you very much .

<user> Do you develop films here ?
<assistant> Yes , we shall . What size do you like ?
<user> Well , the 4 x 6 is fine .
<assistant> Which do you prefer , color or black and white ?
<user> The last one is black and white , all the rest should need color .
<assistant> OK .
<user> I hope they will come out well . When should I pick them up ?
<assistant> They will be ready at noon tomorrow . Each negative develops one print , right ?
<user> Yes , it is . And develop them as glossy as possible .
<assistant> No problem . Do you need another film ?
<user> Yes , a roll of Kodak film please .
<assistant> It is totally  20 including the deposit for films .

<user> How come it is slow as a snail today ?
<assistant> You mean the network connection ?
<user> Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response for any click .
<assistant> I have the same question . I can ' t send out mails . We ' d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately .
<user> Ok .

<user> I need help . I think my arm is broken .
<assistant> Alright . Have you been to this hospital before ?
<user> No , I haven't . I need help quick . It hurts really badly .
<assistant> I understand . It's good you came to the emergency room .
<user> Let me see a doctor .
<assistant> I'm sorry , sir . You will need to wait at least a short time.We are very busy tonight . There was a big car accident on Highway 106 .
<user> I thought this was the emergency room .
<assistant> It is . But unless you are critically injured , you still need to wait.You aren't bleeding , are you ?
<user> No . Only a little . I fell off my porch .
<assistant> Oh , that's terrible . Is it your right arm or your left arm ?
<user> My left arm .
<assistant> Can you fill out this form then ?
<user> No , I can't . I'm left-handed .
<assistant> That's very inconvenient for you then.You ' ll probably have a cast on your left arm .
<user> Yes . But why do I have to fill out a form anyway ? This is the emergency room .
<assistant> Yes , it is . But even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done.Have you ever been in an emergency room before ?

<user> Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice .
<assistant> Yes , it is . Thanks . I ' m just surfing on the internet .
<user> Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ?
<assistant> This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ' m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee !
<user> That ' s great . Can you do it anywhere ?
<assistant> No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
<user> So , what programs do you have on your laptop ?
<assistant> I ' Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs .
<user> I know you are keen on photography . It ' s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at a
<assistant> It ' s wonderful , isn ' t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I took recently ?

<user> Shall we do some jogging ?
<assistant> OK .
<user> I feel well now .
<assistant> Yes , some exercise is necessary for us .
<user> Quite right .

<user> I was wondering if you need any help on your new project .

<user> I would like to help with the computer work .
<assistant> Great ! We are going to be working in teams of three . Are you OK working with others ?
<user> Yes , I like working like that .
<assistant> We will begin next Monday . Would you be available then ?

<assistant> Well , if you could send me your basic background information before next Monday , it would be useful .
<user> OK , I will send the information to you .
<assistant> Well then , thanks for your help . Have a great day !

<user> Congratulations , Francis . Your hard working finally pays off . I am so happy for your promotion .
<assistant> Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it .
<user> I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ?
<assistant> Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ' t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful .
<user> How do you think if I volunteer for some work ?
<assistant> I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives .

<user> Taxi !
<assistant> Yes , sir . Where to ?
<user> The city square , please .
<assistant> Are you in a hurry ?
<user> Yes , I have to be there to meet a friend at 5 thirty pm . So we're sure we can get there on time ?
<assistant> I'm afraid not , sir . Generally we can , but you know how it is in the rush hour now .
<user> I see . Here's the extra 5  for you if you can get me there on time .
<assistant> All right . I'll do my best .
<user> Oh.we made it . Thank you . How much do I own you ?

<user> Janice , I can't find the document I was working on last month . Can you help me to look for it ?
<assistant> Susan , I'm sorry . Did you look up those files I requested ?
<user> Yes , but I still can not find it . Maybe it is in this cabinet .
<assistant> I couldn't find the files you request , even though I checked all the cross-references . I don't think it's there .
<user> I am sure that document was filed .
<assistant> Well , let me check again under a different heading .
<user> Good idea ! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files .
<assistant> Maybe that's why I couldn't find it . All the documents on Nova are filed under ' V ' .

<user> What would you have ?
<assistant> I'll try Chinese wine .
<user> What about this dry red ? It's good indeed , it never goes to the head .

<assistant> You do realize that you ran a red light , don't you ?
<user> I did ?
<assistant> You didn't see the red light ?
<user> I'm sorry for running it , but I really didn't know .
<assistant> Didn't you learn that red means stop ?
<user> I know that .
<assistant> Then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light .
<user> I'm not sure .
<assistant> I'm giving you a ticket for this .
<user> I'm sorry for the misunderstanding .
<assistant> Maybe you'll think about this before you decide to run another light .

<user> Medicine Industry , this is Peter Bush speaking , can I help you ?
<assistant> Good afternoon , could you connect this call with Mr Brown , please
<user> May I know who's calling ?

<user> I'm sorry , Mrs Li , Mr Brown is now in a meeting.May I have your number , and ask him to call you back later ?

<assistant> OK , thank you very much .
<user> Not at all . That's what I should do .

<user> Bob , would you come and help me ?
<assistant> Of course . What do you want me to do , Mom ?
<user> Could you hold these packages while I look for the key ?
<assistant> Alright , what's in them ? They are so heavy !
<user> Just things we need for the picnic tomorrow .
<assistant> Well , hurry up and open the door please . I told you these things are heavy .
<user> I'm sorry , but I just can't find the key . You must have it .
<assistant> Oh , yes , it's in my pocket . But how can I get the key while I'm holding all these bags ?

<user> Excuse me . My name is Dan Ford . I have an appointment with the dentist at 3:30 .

<user> Thank you .

<user> Isn't it past your bedtime already ?
<assistant> I am not sleepy .
<user> It's getting late , and you have to wake up early tomorrow .
<assistant> There is no way that I can fall asleep right now .
<user> Try listening to some soft music .
<assistant> It won't work . I'm nowhere close to being tired .
<user> I really don't care , just go to sleep .
<assistant> What if I stay up and do something , until I get tired ?
<user> You'll be up all night if I let you do that .
<assistant> I'm going to get to sleep eventually .
<user> You need to go to sleep now , so go to sleep .
<assistant> Good night .

<user> I want to go try on these clothes .
<assistant> What did you find ?
<user> I found some jeans , and a new blouse .
<assistant> Go and try it on .
<user> What do you think ?
<assistant> I love that shirt on you .
<user> What about the jeans ?
<assistant> They don't really fit you right .
<user> I don't think so either .
<assistant> That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you though .
<user> Well , I'll just buy the shirt .
<assistant> That would be a good idea .

<user> Now , Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I ' Ve had the chance to look it over and I must say I ' m quite impressed .
<assistant> Thank you very much . I ' Ve tried to keep it short and clear . If there ' s any questions please feel free to ask me .
<user> Well yes , I do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I ' d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
<assistant> Yes , of course . Well as you can see from the resume I ' m 27 and grew up in Brooklyn , New York , although our family moved to London when I was quite young , at around sixteen .
<user> Ah I see , so you were actually educated in Europe ?
<assistant> Yes precisely . Although I was born in the US , I would definitely call London home . But as you see I ' Ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . My Father was in the oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia too .
<user> Very interesting . So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood .
<assistant> Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ' m really looking to settle down .
<user> I see . okay , well let ' s move on to discuss your education shall we ?

<user> Can you tell me , Ms . Smith , about the training programs you initiated this year ?
<assistant> We ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained .
<user> What ' s the result ?
<assistant> We directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50  to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received .
<user> That seems very impressive . Good work !
<assistant> Thank you , but I cannot take all the credit . Our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level .

<user> Well , good morning , Tom . I haven't seen you for a long time .
<assistant> I'd been feeling pretty well until just a few days ago .
<user> What seems to be the trouble now ?
<assistant> I feel run down , tired . I've been having headaches almost every day . And I'm not getting as much sleep as usually do .
<user> Have you been eating properly ? Eating the right kind of food is important for your health , you know .
<assistant> Well , I haven't been eating well , I guess . I usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch .
<user> And what about dinner ?
<assistant> Sometimes I'm too tired to eat anything at all .
<user> That's not good . You don't have a well-balanced diet . Have you been taking vitamin pills ?
<assistant> I don't like to take any medicine at all without talking it over with a doctor first .

<assistant> How long have you had this pain ?
<user> For about a week or so , but it ' s gotten really bad in the last couple of days .
<assistant> Did you do anything that might have aggravated your tooth ?
<user> You know , I was eating jawbreakers in the movies the other day , and I accidentally bit down really hard on one .
<assistant> What kind of toothbrush do you use ?
<user> I just use a regular hard bristle toothbrush .
<assistant> Does it bother you when you eat something really cold ?
<user> Yes , it definitely bothers me more when I do that .

<user> Good evening .

<user> Let's go to the animal shelter .
<assistant> What do you want to do ?
<user> I want to get a puppy for my son .
<assistant> That will make him so happy .
<user> I'll get him one of those little dogs .
<assistant> One that won't grow up too big .
<user> And eat too much .
<assistant> Do you know which one he would like ?

<user> Hello . I want to send the computer to my sister in Shanghai by logistics transport .
<assistant> OK . Is it in the box ? May I see it ?
<user> Yes . This is the computer and this is the keyboard and the monitor .
<assistant> Is there anything else ?
<user> There are a mouse and a camera .
<assistant> Is that all ?
<user> Yes . How much is it to send these things to Shanghai by regular delivery ?
<assistant> It depends on the weight of these things . Generally speaking , we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram .
<user> I see . Can you weigh them for me , please ?
<assistant> Please go over there to weigh them .
<user> OK . See you later .

<user> what happened ? Why didn't he win ?
<assistant> didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .
<user> how did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
<assistant> if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .
<user> what ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
<assistant> he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
<user> I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
<assistant> they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
<user> that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
<assistant> I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
<user> regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .
<assistant> I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
<user> let's hope so .

<user> I need to use the ATM .
<assistant> What ' s stopping you ?
<user> I ' m not sure how .
<assistant> I don ' t understand .
<user> I ' Ve never used one before .
<assistant> I can help you figure it out .
<user> What do I have to do ?
<assistant> Slide your card into the machine .
<user> Then what ?
<assistant> You need to type your PIN in .
<user> What do I have to do next ?
<assistant> Click on whichever option you want , and you ' re done .

<user> What are you doing ? Checking the " to do " list for the wedding ?
<assistant> Yep . There's still so much to do !
<user> So let's start by checking off what we've already done .
<assistant> Did you reconfirm the plane reservations for all the Taiwanese guests ?
<user> Not yet , I was busy getting that videographer who films stuff for the Net .
<assistant> Cool ! I can't believe he agreed to go all the way to Dallas with us !
<user> Hey ! We're paying for his ticket !

<user> It is my first time coming to China . I want to buy something unique of China to my friends as gifts .
<assistant> We have a great variety of Chinese antiques and porcelain . Do you like them ?
<user> Yes , I love them , but they are fragile . It is not convenient to take them .
<assistant> You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ?
<user> Sounds good . May I have a look ?
<assistant> Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on .
<user> They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs .
<assistant> All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality .
<user> Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ?
<assistant> This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac .
<user> Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones .
<assistant> OK , I will wrap them for you .

<user> Can you make out what he's saying ?
<assistant> No , it's too loud in here .

<user> Excuse me .
<assistant> Yes ?

<assistant> Certainly . Go along Queen's Road ...
<user> Along Queen's Road ...
<assistant> Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel .
<user> Right at the Hilton .
<assistant> Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral .
<user> The Cathedral ?
<assistant> Yes . Then cross the road at the next traffic lights . The Peak Tram is straight ahead . You can't miss it .
<user> That's very kind of you . Thank you . Er ... have you got a pencil ?
<assistant> Yes . Why ?
<user> Can you repeat all that ? I think I'd better write it down .

<user> Hi , Nally , are you hungry ?
<assistant> I'm starving . Let's go grab a bite .
<user> Where to ?
<assistant> How about Karlis ?
<user> Are you kidding ? That place is too ritzy for lunch .
<assistant> True . ok Let's go to Grumose ?
<user> Same thing , meals there all coarsen arm and leg .
<assistant> I guess it is a little pricy .
<user> Let's stop it at Multicolor for a quick lunch ..
<assistant> That will be Ok . Come on , I can't wait to chow down .
<user> That was a great lunch , the food was good , but the service was lousy .
<assistant> Is that why you stiffed the waiter ?
<user> You got it . All right , Let's go back to school .

<user> Good morning , sir .
<assistant> Good morning . I'd like a business suit made with this material .
<user> Do you have a particular style in mind ?
<assistant> The kind that never goes out of fashion , I guess .
<user> I think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes .
<assistant> I'm sure you're right . I just dread the idea of making a new suit every year .
<user> The changes are usually not that dramatic . We just got some pictures of the latest fashion . Would you like to take a look ?
<assistant> Good . I think I'll choose this single breasted one . When can I get it ?
<user> Next Friday .
<assistant> Thank you .

<user> Oh , gosh ! I feel everything around me is against me .
<assistant> Don't take it too hard . There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 .
<user> Well , I am all ears . Maybe they are helpful .
<assistant> Firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . And secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . The last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age .
<user> I understand what you mean , and I will not upset myself . Face it .
<assistant> Good luck to us .

<user> Look , Mary ! There are so many people over there !
<assistant> Oh , I remember , there is a job fair in the personnel market .
<user> I have never been to the personnel market .
<assistant> Really ? I have been there several times .
<user> Are there many employers ?
<assistant> Yes . The personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers .
<user> So there will be many large companies in the personnel market , right ?
<assistant> Yes , there are many famous corporations .
<user> When will there be a job fair ?
<assistant> Every Saturday and Sunday
<user> Do I need to pay to go into the personnel market ?
<assistant> No , it's free .
<user> How about going there to have a look now ?
<assistant> OK , let's go .

<user> Could you show me the T-shirt on the model ?
<assistant> Here you are . We have three different colors , white , blue and pink .
<user> What's the price ?
<assistant>  12 .
<user> Can you make it any cheaper ?
<assistant> It is cheap .
<user> I'll take it if you give me a discount .
<assistant>  10 . That's the best I can do .
<user> OK . I'll take the blue one .

<user> Hello , again . Did you discuss everything with your colleagues ?
<assistant> Yes , yes . It seems that everything is settled .
<user> Have you decided how you would like the salaries paid ?
<assistant> We have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees's accounts , whether they are currently with this bank or not .
<user> That's not a problem .
<assistant> Of course , if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank , or open new accounts with you .
<user> Thank you very much . We always welcome new customers .

<user> I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking .
<assistant> We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments .
<user> I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house .
<assistant> We need to find a good realtor .
<user> Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .
<assistant> What do you mean ?
<user> Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .
<assistant> But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .
<user> Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .
<assistant> I still think we should have a realtor.We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also , the realtor will inspect the house.He can tell us if the house has
<user> Of course we need a home inspector.But we can hire an inspector on our own.And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .
<assistant> So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?
<user> It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .
<assistant> And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?
<user> Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .
<assistant> Why ?
<user> Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .
<assistant> Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .
<user> It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .
<assistant> I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .
<user> Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store .

<user> I'm calling about our appointment . I can't call on you this evening.My wife is terribly ill .
<assistant> Sorry to hear that .
<user> How about next week ?
<assistant> Fine , we'll be expecting you then .

<user> Which restaurant do you prefer ?
<assistant> I'd like to taste Mexican food .
<user> How about the one on Baker Street ?
<assistant> Oh , I've never seen a better Mexican restaurant .

<user> The numbers in this table don't seem to be in accord with reality .
<assistant> I know , but these are the figures that we came up with .

<user> Oh , so the zoo is over there . Thank you so much for your help .
<assistant> You ' re welcome . Can I ask you what brings you to China ?
<user> I ' m actually travelling around Asia .
<assistant> Oh , very nice . How long will you be in Beijing ?
<user> Probably another week .
<assistant> Oh , I see . Well , I ' ll give you my phone number and if you need a guide , please call me .
<user> Thank you very much . That ' s very kind .

<user> Could you type up this document for me , Sandra ?
<assistant> Sure , but I have to finish this report first .
<user> Never mind . I'll do it .

<user> Are you interested in mountaineering ?
<assistant> Yes , in some sense . I should say I like mountain climbing , you know , because I'm not so professional . How about you
<user> I'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . I went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation . We spent two days in the mountains .
<assistant> How did you spend the night there ?
<user> We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful .
<assistant> I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country .
<user> Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't ?
<assistant> Yes . It is one of the Five Mountains .
<user> I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ?
<assistant> I'd love to .

<assistant> I know , I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world !
<user> Really ? What's the series about ?
<assistant> Well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it .
<user> It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth .

<user> So that concludes the introduction . Now let's move to the first part of my talk , which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan . So first , right off the bat , When looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ...
<assistant> We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ...
<user> That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket .

<user> Excuse me , sir , may I talk to you ?
<assistant> Bill ! Sure , come on in . What can I do for you ?
<user> Well sir , as you know , I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years .

<user> I won ' t beat around the bush . Sir , I would like a raise . I currently have three companies after me and so I decided to talk to you first .
<assistant> A raise ? Son , I would love to give you a raise , but this is just not the right time .
<user> I understand your position , and I know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales , but you must also take into consideration my hard work , pro-activeness and loyalty to this company for over a decade .
<assistant> Taking into account these factors , and considering I don ' t want to start a brain drain , I ' m willing to offer you a ten percent raise and an extra five days of vacation time . How does that sound ?
<user> Great ! It ' s a deal ! Thank you , sir !
<assistant> Before you go , just out of curiosity , what companies were after you ?
<user> Oh , the electric company , gas company and water company !

<user> They think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't , so ended up biting him in his face .
<assistant> Wow . What does his look like now ?
<user> It looks pretty frightening . He doesn't have any lips , so all you can see are his gums and teeth . Most of his nose and chin are missing too .

<user> Hey there Chris , what are you up to ?
<assistant> I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models .
<user> Oh , so you're thinking about buying a new car ?
<assistant> Yeah , it looks that way . My wife has been bugging me about it . I thought we could probably survive without one , but with a baby on the way , maybe it is time to get a car .
<user> So this would be your first automobile ?
<assistant> That's right . For quite a few years , I rode a bicycle to work . Then I got a motorbike .
<user> Yeah , I think I can understand your wife's position . Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order .
<assistant> Oh ... I don't let her ride with me . It's just too dangerous . She takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot .
<user> So it's time to buy your very first car ! Wow , that's exciting !
<assistant> Yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility .
<user> Yeah . I still remember my first car . It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17 . I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car .
<assistant> I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us .
<user> Yeah , it is a tough call . Each one has its pros and cons . Are you looking for a sedan ?
<assistant> Yes , I'd like a Jeep , but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives .
<user> I'd advise you to listen to your wife . She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice .

<user> Can I help you ?
<assistant> I'd like to send a fax to Shenzhen .

<user> You can't send this document ; it is not clear enough to send . The photograph is all right .
<assistant> Well , how long will it take to arrive in Shenzhen ?
<user> Couple of minutes .
<assistant> Great . How much ?
<user> 5  . You should change another much clearer photograph for fax .
<assistant> Thank you . I will deal with it .

<user> Good morning , can I see your passport , please ?
<assistant> Here you are .

<user> Take care , Peter . Don't run so fast . Are you tired ?
<assistant> Oh , yes . May I sit on the grass ?
<user> No , you mustn't sit on the grass . Don't you see the notes ?
<assistant> Yes , I can see it . But what's on it ?
<user> It says ' Keep off the grass ! '
<assistant> Well , there's a bench under the tree . We can sit there .
<user> Be careful . You can't smoke here .

<assistant> Certainly , every room in this hotel has a private bath .
<user> Does my room have twin beds or a double ? I prefer a room with twin beds .
<assistant> Your room has twin beds , Mr.Lee . It also has a view . I am sure you will like it . This is your key . It's on the eighth floor room 801 . The elevator's over there .
<user> Thank you . One more thing , where is your restaurant ?
<assistant> The restaurant is on the second floor . We also have a cafeteria on the top floor . If you would like something to drink , you can either call room service or come down here . The bar is right behind the lobby .
<user> Thank you , you are very kind !
<assistant> You are welcome !
